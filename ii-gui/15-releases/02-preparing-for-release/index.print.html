<p>Before we release our software, there are a few steps that we should perform to make sure it is ready for release. Most of these steps are things that we&rsquo;ve already been doing as part of our development process, but it is always good to review them once again and make sure everything is ready for release.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: where possible, make sure your project includes adequate unit testing. You should aim to achieve a high level of code coverage, but also keep in mind that code coverage is not a substitute for actually making sure your tests properly test the code for errors.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: add documentation comments to your code, and use them to generate useful documentation for your users. Ideally, the code comments should be detailed enough to allow any other developer to interface with your code if it is a library, or possibly add their own features. You may also need to write a short <code>README.md</code> file giving basic instructions for how to use your application.</li>
<li><strong>Code Style</strong>: make sure your code does not contain any style errors. Tools such as <code>checkstyle</code> and <code>flake8</code> are powerful ways to make sure your code is complete, easy to read, and follows standard coding styles.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging &amp; Logging</strong>: review your code and make sure that any debugging statements are either disabled or configured properly. Likewise, you may wish to adjust the amount of logging performed, or disable logging entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Review &amp; Reduce Dependencies</strong>: if your application relies on many external dependencies or libraries, you may want to review them and make sure they are strictly required. The fewer dependencies your application has, the easier it is for your users to manage those dependencies. If needed, provide an easy way to acquire dependencies using build tools such as <code>Gradle</code> or <code>pip3</code>, or consider packaging dependencies with your application if the license allows it.</li>
<li><strong>Test on Multiple Platforms</strong>: where possible, try to use your application on as many different platforms and versions of the underlying programming language as possible. A common issue is that software works correctly on the developer&rsquo;s system, only to cause issues when executed on another version or operating system.</li>
<li><strong>Make Hard Coded Variables Configurable</strong>: if your application includes any hard-coded variables that would need to be changed by the user, consider making them configurable using a configuration file. A popular option is to use a clone of the <code>dotenv</code> project from the Ruby programming language. Popular options include <a href="https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java" target="_blank">dotenv-java</a>
 for Java and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/" target="_blank">python-dotenv</a>
 for Python.</li>
<li><strong>Remove any Sensitive Information</strong>: make sure that your code or configuration files don&rsquo;t include any sensitive information, such as default passwords, API or SSH keys, or any other information that would not be good to release publicly. If this information has been committed to git, you will want to remove it from the repository&rsquo;s history as well. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository" target="_blank">Removing sensitive data from a repository</a>
 guide from GitHub for information on how to do this.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Name</strong>: before releasing your software, it is very helpful to come up with a uniquely identifiable name, especially if you intend to publish it to a software repository such as <a href="https://search.maven.org/" target="_blank">Maven Central</a>
 or <a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">PyPi</a>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, these are just a few of the things we may want to review before deciding our application is ready for publication. It&rsquo;s always worth taking the time to think about how useful our application will be to our users before taking the next step.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;re going to quickly discuss what it will take to package our application and create a release that others can easily download and use in their own applications. First, let&rsquo;s talk about all the steps we might want to take to prepare our software for release. First and foremost, we should thoroughly test our software and make sure it is as free of bugs and errors as we can get. Having ample unit tests is very helpful at this point, and it can also help anyone who wants to help improve the application by giving them a quick and easy way to confirm that nothing is broken. In addition, you&rsquo;ll want to take some time to document your code, both in code comments but also by creating some user documentation to help users understand how to best use the application. As you go through the code, you should try to clean up any unnecessary debugging or logging statements, either by commenting them out or turning them off. You can also look at the dependencies for your application and determine if you really need them or if they can be easily removed. In addition, you&rsquo;ll want to look at the licenses for your dependencies and make sure you understand the limitations placed on them and how that might affect your ability to publish your software. Once you are ready to publish, you&rsquo;ll want to take the time to test your system on multiple different platforms, operating systems, computer types, and just about anywhere you think a user might try to use it. You may also want to explore adding some easy configuration options to your application - both Java and Python include implementations of the <code>dotenv</code> library from the Ruby programming that make this really simple. You should also make sure your code doesn&rsquo;t contain any sensitive information such as API keys or passwords - there are lots of horror stories online of companies being compromised due to sensitive information being pushed to a GitHub repository. Finally, once you&rsquo;ve reached the end and you&rsquo;re ready to publish, you&rsquo;ll be faced with one of the two hardest problems in computer science - naming things! You&rsquo;ll need to come up with a hopefully unique and catchy name for your application so others can find it easily.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, the next step is to choose a software license. As discussed in the previous chapter, you have a few options. First, if you don&rsquo;t do anything, your software will automatically be copyrighted, and it will prevent most anyone from using it legally. So, instead, you can choose to apply a public domain license to release it there, or apply a permissive license such as the MIT or Apache license to make it easy to use while protecting you from any liability. If you want to make sure any improvements or derivatives of your work are also free, you&rsquo;ll most likely want to use a copyleft license such as the GNU GPL. And finally, if you want to retain more restrictive rights, you&rsquo;ll probably want to look into a proprietary license and consulting a lawyer to help.</p>
<p>Next, as you prepare your application for release, you&rsquo;ll probably need to add a bit of metadata to the application&rsquo;s package. At a minimum, you&rsquo;ll most likely add the version and the name, as well as determine the full package path for your application. In addition, depending on where you plan to distribute the software, you may have additional requirements to meet.</p>
<p>At this point, you can now start to publish your content. The first and easiest thing to do is to publish your documentation. We&rsquo;ve already shown how to create it automatically using tools such as Javadoc or pdoc, so all we really have to do is get it moved to the <code>docs</code> folder in our GitHub repository and then enable GitHub Pages on our repository. Thankfully, GitHub will take care of all of our web hosting needs just like that. Alternatively, we can choose to host it on our own website if desired.</p>
<p>Ok, so now we are finally ready to create a package. This process is pretty simple, but we&rsquo;ll cover it in the example project for this chapter. So, check that our for an interactive example of creating a JAR file in Java and a Wheel file in Python.</p>
<p>At long last, we&rsquo;ve created our package and we&rsquo;re ready to publish. In many cases, this can be as simple as creating a new release tag on GitHub and then uploading our created packages as attachments to the release. For many developers, that&rsquo;s the last step. However, if we want, we can also look at what it takes to host our application on the library repository for our language. For Python developers, it is super simple and painless to upload a package to the Python Package Index! However, that means that the packages out there aren&rsquo;t really subjected to any rigorous review, and it is likely that someone could already be using the name we&rsquo;d like to use. So, it comes with a few caveats. For Java developers, the process of uploading a package to Maven Central is pretty difficult, but that difficulty is required to make sure that the package posted on Maven Central come from trusted developers and there are no name conflicts. So, as with PyPI, there are some pros and cons to that approach. In either case, there are ample resources available online to help you with that last step if you desire.</p>
<p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve learned all about creating a release for our application, and we&rsquo;ll get to explore some of this process in the example project for this chapter. Hopefully at some point you&rsquo;ll be able to put this information to use and publish your first program online!</p>
