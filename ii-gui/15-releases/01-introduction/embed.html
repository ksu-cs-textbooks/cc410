<p>At some point, we may decide that the application or library we are developing is ready for release. In that case, there are a few things we can do to help make our application easier to install and use for our potential users.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll briefly discuss some of the steps in that process and the decisions we may need to make along the way. This is not meant to be a full guide to releasing a professional piece of software, but it should help you navigate some of the first steps toward making your application available to a wider audience.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll discuss these topics and terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software release</li>
<li>Software license</li>
<li>Metadata</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Building a JAR file (Java)</li>
<li>Building a Wheel file (Python)</li>
<li>Posting a Release on GitHub</li>
<li>Publishing a Release on a Repository</li>
</ul>
<p>After this chapter, we&rsquo;ll also have a short example project that goes through these steps, allowing you to create your own software release!</p>
