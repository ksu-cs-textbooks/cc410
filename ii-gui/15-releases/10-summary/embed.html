<p>In this chapter, we learned about the steps we can follow to create packaged released of our applications. We discussed changes we could make to our applications to prepare for a release, as well as the various licenses we can choose to attach to our application.</p>
<p>We also looked at some of the helpful metadata that we may wish to add to our project, and how to deploy our documentation directly to the Internet using GitHub pages.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw how to create a package in both Java and Python, and how to upload those packages to a release on GitHub. We also discussed the basic steps for uploading a package to the repository for our chosen language.</p>
<p>In the example project for this module, we&rsquo;ll go through some of the steps for creating our own packaged releases and how to upload them to GitHub.</p>
