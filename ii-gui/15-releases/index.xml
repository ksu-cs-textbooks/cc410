      <description>At some point, we may decide that the application or library we are developing is ready for release. In that case, there are a few things we can do to help make our application easier to install and use for our potential users.&#xA;In this chapter, we’ll briefly discuss some of the steps in that process and the decisions we may need to make along the way. This is not meant to be a full guide to releasing a professional piece of software, but it should help you navigate some of the first steps toward making your application available to a wider audience.</description>

      <title>Preparing for Release</title>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;Before we release our software, there are a few steps that we should perform to make sure it is ready for release. Most of these steps are things that we’ve already been doing as part of our development process, but it is always good to review them once again and make sure everything is ready for release.&#xA;Unit Testing: where possible, make sure your project includes adequate unit testing.</description>

      <title>Choosing a License</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/15-releases/03-choosing-a-license/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/15-releases/03-choosing-a-license/</guid>
      <description>The next major step in releasing a piece of software is to choose a license. Adding a license to your software allows you to specify what the software can be used for, who can use it, and how they can make use of it either within their own applications or by possibly distributing and building derivative works.&#xA;In the previous chapter, we discussed various software licenses and what they mean when we try to use a library under that license.</description>

      <title>Metadata</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/15-releases/04-metadata/</guid>
      <description>Another major step in creating a software release is to add some metadata to your project. The metadata attached to an application typically includes items such as the version, author, and title. Depending on the format, it may also include additional items such as the main website for the application, and a place where bugs or issues may be reported.&#xA;The Java JAR file format includes a file named Manifest.txt that can include this information.</description>

      <description>As part of the “Hello Real World” project in this course, we learned how to automatically generate documentation for our application based on the documentation comments included in our code. That documentation can be very valuable for anyone who wishes to use or modify our application, so we want to make it available for everyone.&#xA;While it is possible for anyone to download our source code and generate this documentation themselves, many times we want to make this even easier by posting the documentation directly on the Internet.</description>

      <description>Building a JAR file using Gradle is super simple - it handles almost all of the heavy lifting for us. The basic steps are outlined in the Building Java Libraries Simple guide in the Gradle documentation. Below, we’ll go through the steps we’ll need to follow for most of the applications we’ve created in this course.&#xA;Run the Build Task If we haven’t already, we should first run the Gradle build task.</description>

      <description>Building a Python wheel file is super simple using the setuptools library - it handles almost all of the heavy lifting for us. The basic steps are outlined in the Packaging Python Projects guide in the Python documentation. Below, we’ll go through the steps we’ll need to follow for most of the applications we’ve created in this course.&#xA;Create Pyproject.toml First, we’ll need to create a file named pyproject.toml in the root our project directory.</description>

      <title>GitHub Releases</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/15-releases/08-github-releases/</guid>
      <description>Finally, we’ve completed creating our package, and we’re ready to publish it. One of the easiest options is to include our package files directly in a GitHub release on GitHub.&#xA;In the “Hello Real World” example project, we learned how to create a release on GitHub using a tag. The only thing we’ll do differently this time is upload our packages to the release. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to select them directly from the repository, so we may have to download the package files from the dist directory to our computer first before starting this step.</description>

      <title>Publication</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/15-releases/09-publication/</link>

      <description>At long last, we have a package ready to go! The last optional step would be to publish our package to a package repository so others can easily download and use it through their development tools. We won’t directly do that as part of this course, but below are some quick links and basic instructions to follow if you’d like to publish a package to a repository for your language.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we learned about the steps we can follow to create packaged released of our applications. We discussed changes we could make to our applications to prepare for a release, as well as the various licenses we can choose to attach to our application.&#xA;We also looked at some of the helpful metadata that we may wish to add to our project, and how to deploy our documentation directly to the Internet using GitHub pages.</description>
