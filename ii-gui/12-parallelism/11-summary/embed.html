<p>In this chapter, we learned about <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>threads</strong>. A process is an instance of an application running on our computer, and it can be broken up into multiple <strong>threads</strong> of execution.</p>
<p>Creating threads is very simple - in most cases, we just need to define a function that is used as the starting point for the thread. However, in multithreaded programs, dealing with shared memory can be tricky, and if done incorrectly we can run into <strong>race conditions</strong> which cause our programs to possibly lose data.</p>
<p>To combat this, programming languages and our operating system provide methods for <strong>thread synchronization</strong>, namely <strong>locks</strong> that prevent multiple threads from running at the same time.</p>
<p>Then, we saw some quick examples for how to create threads in both Java and Python, and how to handle basic race conditions through the use of locks in each language.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll introduce <strong>event-driven programming</strong>, which depends on multiple threads to make our GUI responsive to the user even while our application is doing work in the background.</p>
