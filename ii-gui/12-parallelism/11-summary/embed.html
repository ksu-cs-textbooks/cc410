<p>In this chapter, we learned about <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>threads</strong>. A process is an instance of an application running on our computer, and it can be broken up into multiple <strong>threads</strong> of execution.</p>
<p>Creating threads is very simple - in most cases, we just need to define a function that is used as the starting point for the thread. However, in multithreaded programs, dealing with shared memory can be tricky, and if done incorrectly we can run into <strong>race conditions</strong> which cause our programs to possibly lose data.</p>
<p>To combat this, programming languages and our operating system provide methods for <strong>thread synchronization</strong>, namely <strong>locks</strong> that prevent multiple threads from running at the same time.</p>
<p>Then, we saw some quick examples for how to create threads in both Java and Python, and how to handle basic race conditions through the use of locks in each language.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we&rsquo;ll introduce <strong>event-driven programming</strong>, which depends on multiple threads to make our GUI responsive to the user even while our application is doing work in the background.</p>

# Process

In a computer, a **process** is best described as what?

1. [X] An instance of a computer program that is running
1. [ ] A sequence of instructions in a program
1. [ ] The memory stored in a running process
1. [ ] A method for synchronizing running programs

# Scheduler

A **scheduler** in an operating system is responsible for what task?

1. [X] Determining which processes to execute at any given time
1. [ ] Choosing when to turn off the computer 
1. [ ] Automatically updating the computer
1. [ ] Keeping track of which program was installed most recently

# Context Switching

**Context switching** on a computer is the process of performing what task?

1. [X] Swapping between running processes
1. [ ] Switching between open windows
1. [ ] Changing the currently logged-in user
1. [ ] Using two versions of the same software

# Thread

In a computer, a **thread** is best described as what?

1. [ ] An instance of a computer program that is running
1. [X] A sequence of instructions in a program
1. [ ] The memory stored in a running process
1. [ ] A method for synchronizing running programs

# Containment

Which of the following statements regarding threads and processes in a computer is the most accurate?

1. [X] A process can contain multiple threads
1. [ ] A thread can contain multiple processes
1. [ ] A thread can belong to multiple processes
1. [ ] A process can belong to multiple threads

# Multiple Threads

Which of the following reasons is given for why we would want to run multiple threads in a GUI-based program?

1. [X] The GUI runs in one thread and the program does work in another
1. [ ] Multiple users can use the program simultaneously
1. [ ] The GUI can only talk to a single thread
1. [ ] A single thread doesn't have enough memory for a GUI to operate

# Running Threads

Which of the following statements regarding threads is the most accurate?

1. [X] We cannot control when a thread will be interrupted by another thread
1. [ ] We can control exactly when a thread will run on a system
1. [ ] We can predict exactly how long a thread will run on a system
1. [ ] A program's threads must all run on the same processor core

# Race Condition

Which of the following statements best describes a **race condition** in parallel programming?

1. [X] Two threads try to update the same value at the same time
1. [ ] One program finishes before another one starts
1. [ ] Two programs try to read the same file at the same time
1. [ ] Two variables contain the same exact value

# Lock

A **lock** in parallel programming is used to perform what task?

1. [X] Prevent two threads from accessing the same data
1. [ ] Protect a file from unwanted changes
1. [ ] Encrypt secure passwords in a vault
1. [ ] Make sure the assembly code is not overwritten

# Deadlock

What is the primary cause of **deadlock** in a computer program?

1. [X] A thread acquires a lock and does not release it
1. [ ] Threads not using locks to access data
1. [ ] Processes that contain a single thread
1. [ ] A thread acquires and quickly releases a lock repeatedly
