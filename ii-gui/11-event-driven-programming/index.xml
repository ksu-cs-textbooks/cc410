      <description>Video Materials
The first step in building a program using event-driven programming is actually creating the events that you&amp;rsquo;d like to respond to. For a GUI-based program, this is actually handled by the GUI framework itself. It includes a large number of events that are already available for us to use. Instead, we have to bind those events to special functions, called event handlers, within our code. Then, when those events occur, the GUI framework will call the event handler associated with that event.</description>

      <description>Video Materials
Most GUI frameworks, such as Java Swing and tkinter, handle user interactions through the use of a loop, which runs within the GUI thread and listens for events generated by the user.
1
When an event is generated by the user, it is first placed in an event queue, which is a queue-based data structure used to keep track of events generated by the user. The events are placed there by a thread in the program, usually part of the GUI framework, that is connected and &amp;ldquo;listening&amp;rdquo; for events from the operating system.</description>

      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned to create a GUI and switch between panels in the GUI, but we&amp;rsquo;ve not really looked at how to make our GUI buttons responsive and perform the actions we want when the user clicks on them. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into event-driven programming, which is the programming paradigm we use to construct applications that use GUIs and event handlers.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can build our application to include multiple threads, making our application appear responsive to the user even if the application is performing calculations in another thread.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/ii-gui/11-event-driven-programming/02-gui-threads/</guid>
      <description>Up to this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve only created applications that use a single thread. However, now that we are writing applications that include a GUI, we must start to build applications that use multiple threads to manage its work. Otherwise, if the application is busy working on a particular task while the user clicks a button in the GUI, the GUI won&amp;rsquo;t respond to the user until our task is complete.</description>

      <title>Event Handlers</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/ii-gui/11-event-driven-programming/04-event-handlers/</guid>
      <description>At its core, an event handler is simply a piece of code that is called when a particular event happens within the GUI. The function typically receives additional information about the event, such as the source of the event and any relevant details. In some languages, we also refer to event handlers as callbacks.
Java Listeners In Java, most events are handled by special interfaces called &amp;ldquo;listeners&amp;rdquo; that we can implement within our code.</description>

      <description>The Java Swing GUI toolkit uses a special thread called the Event Dispatch Thread (abbreviated EDT) to handle events. This thread is where most of the code that interacts with a GUI written in Swing actually runs, leaving the main application thread to do other tasks as needed.
Starting the Thread In all of our examples so far, we have observed a unique piece of code in the main() method that is used to actually launch our GUI-based programs:</description>

      <description>In Python tkinter, we have an event loop that runs in the background, handling all of the GUI updates as well as responding to any events in the event queue by calling the appropriate callback function.
Starting the Thread In all of our examples so far, we have observed a unique piece of code in the main() method that is used to actually launch our GUI-based programs:
MainWindow().mainloop() The tk.Tk.mainloop() method is used to start the event loop attached to the top-level tk.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we learned about event-driven programming and how to configure our GUI-based programs to respond to actions taken by the user.
When the user interacts with our GUI, an event is created by the operating system and placed in the event queue. Then, our program uses an event loop to check the queue for incoming events, and respond to them. When an event is found, our program determines if that event has been bound to a particular event handler, also known as a listener or callback.</description>
