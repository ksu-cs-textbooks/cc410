      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the various common elements that we can use to build our graphical user interfaces for our application. This window show some of the most common elements used in GUIs today, but of course there are others we can choose from that are built into our GUI frameworks, and we can also create our own elements as well. In this diagram, we see many different items annotated, most of which we will discuss separately on later slides in this video.</description>
