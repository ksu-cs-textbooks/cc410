    <title>Elements :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/11-gui-basics/07-elements/video/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Now let’s look at the various common elements that we can use to build our graphical user interfaces for our application. This window show some of the most common elements used in GUIs today, but of course there are others we can choose from that are built into our GUI frameworks, and we can also create our own elements as well. In this diagram, we see many different items annotated, most of which we will discuss separately on later slides in this video. I do want to call your attention to the first few callouts at the top of the graphic. We see the overall window itself, which is created by the GUI toolkit by interacting with the host operating system that our application is running on. Within the window, we can set the window title at the top of the screen, and then we also see the window’s content area, usually represented as a panel in our framework, where we can actually place our content. In most cases, we cannot configure much of the window itself outside of the content area beyond setting the window’s title. The rest is left to the operating system itself.</description>
