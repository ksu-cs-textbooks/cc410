<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we reviewed the basics of creating <strong>graphical user interfaces</strong>, or GUIs, for our programs. We learned about <strong>GUI frameworks</strong> such as <strong>Java Swing</strong> and <strong>Python tkinter</strong>, and how to use them.</p>
<p>We saw that applications are contained within <strong>windows</strong>, which are managed by the <strong>window manager</strong>, part of the operating system that our applications are running under. Inside of those windows, we can place controls such as <strong>panels, labels, text inputs</strong>, and more. To arrange those elements, we can use a <strong>layout manager</strong>.</p>
<p>We then learned how to create a simple &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; GUI in both Java Swing and Python tkinter, which will serve as the basis for the example project attached to this chapter.</p>
<p>In later parts of this course, we&rsquo;ll learn how to react to the various events that are generated by our GUI using <strong>event-driven programming</strong>.</p>
