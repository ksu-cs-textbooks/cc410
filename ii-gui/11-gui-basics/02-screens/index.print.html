<p>Java Swing and Python tkinter are libraries and toolkits for creating Graphical User Interfaces - a user interface that is presented as a combination of interactive graphical and text elements, commonly including buttons, menus, and various flavors of editors and inputs.  GUIs represent a major step forward in usability from earlier programs that were interacted with by typing commands into a text-based terminal (the EPIC software we looked at in the beginning of this textbook is an example of this earlier form of user interface).</p>
<p>The availability of GUIs and the tools used for creating them have changed over the years, especially as the display technologies themselves have evolved.</p>
<h3 id="screen-resolution-and-aspect-ratio">Screen Resolution and Aspect Ratio</h3>
<p>No doubt you are used to having a wide variety of screen resolutions available across a plethora of devices.  But this was not always the case.  Computer monitors once came in very specific, standardized resolutions, and only gradually were these replaced by newer, higher-resolution monitors.  The table below summarizes this time, indicating the approximate period each resolution dominated the market.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Standard</th>
    <th>Size</th>
    <th>Peak Years</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VGA</td>
    <td>640x480</td>
    <td>1987-1990</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SVGA</td>
    <td>800x600</td>
    <td>1990-2003</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>XGA</td>
    <td>1024x768</td>
    <td>2007-2015</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Many of these libraries were introduced in the early 2000s, at a time where the most popular screen resolution in the United States was transitioning from SVGA to XGA, and screen resolutions (especially for business computers running Windows) had remained remarkably consistent for long periods.  Moreover, these resolutions were all using the 4:3 aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height of the screen). Contrast that with trends since that time:</p>

<p>There is no longer a clearly dominating resolution, nor even an aspect ratio! Thus, it has become increasingly important for applications to adapt to different screen resolutions. Altering these values in response to different screen resolution requires significant calculations to resize and reposition the elements, and the code to perform these calculations must be written by the programmer. To deal with this, many graphics libraries added additional features and methods for laying out controls on the screen, automatically positioning them much like a web browser will lay out content on a webpage to fit the screen. With careful design, the need for writing code to position and size elements is eliminated, and the resulting GUIs adapt well to the wide range of available screen sizes.</p>

 article on Wikipedia for a deep dive into this topic!</p>
<h3 id="customizable-styling-and-template-system">Customizable Styling and Template System</h3>
<p>Many modern graphics libraries also leverage controls built around graphical representations provided directly by the hosting operating system.  This helped keep applications looking and feeling like the operating system they were deployed on, but limits the customizability of the controls.  A commonly attempted feature - placing an image on a button - can become an onerous task within some systems.  Attempting to customize controls often required the programmer to take over the rendering work entirely, providing the commands to render the raw shapes of the control directly onto the control&rsquo;s canvas.  Unsurprisingly, an entire secondary market for pre-developed custom controls emerged to help counter this issue.</p>
<p>In addition, many graphics libraries include the ability to &ldquo;skin&rdquo; or change the overall look and feel of the entire user interface quickly. We won&rsquo;t get too far into the design aspects of a good GUI in this course, but students are welcome to play around with the tools they find and see what works best for them.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;re going to look at how we can create graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, for our programs. Thankfully, the technology and frameworks we have available today have greatly simplified this process, but it is still worth looking back at some historical information first, just to get a sense of how things have changed over the years. For example, this slide shows the various standard screen resolutions that have been used on computer systems over the years. In the textbook, we discuss how resolutions such as VGA, or 640 by 480 pixels, were popular in the late 1980s, up through XGA, or 1024 by 768 pixels, which was dominant up through the start of the 2010s. Today, there are a wide variety of resolutions that are commonly used, but it is also very common for users to no longer just use applications in &ldquo;full screen&rdquo; mode, so our applications really could be expected to work for a variety of screen sizes.</p>
<p>Thankfully, much of this work can be offloaded to a GUI framework. A GUI framework is a code library that can interface directly with the operating system on our computer, and it handles all of the work to create and display windows on the screen. In addition, GUI frameworks include a number of common GUI elements, such as text boxes, checkboxes, and buttons, giving our programs the same basic interactivity that users are already familiar with. They also allow us to use a standardized look and feel across our applications, and in many cases we can make our application&rsquo;s look and feel match the one of the underlying operating system. Many of these frameworks are cross platform, allowing us to develop our applications once and use them on a variety of different operating systems. In addition, they make creating and modifying our GUIs quick and easy, and many of the more modern frameworks are built in an object-oriented style, making it easy for us to create our own custom elements quickly and reuse them throughout our code.</p>
<p>In this course, we&rsquo;ll look at two different frameworks, one for each language. In Java, we&rsquo;ll use the Java Swing framework, which has been a part of the Java programming language since the late 1990s. This screen shows a sample window that was developed using Java Swing with its default look and feel, which is available on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>For Python, we&rsquo;ll use the tkinter library, which is a Python wrapper around the very popular Tk GUI toolkit. This is a Windows application written using Tk, and it was configured to use a Windows-like look and feel, so it looks almost like a native Windows application itself. Like Java Swing, Tk is available on multiple platforms, so we can use it on nearly any system that runs Python.</p>
