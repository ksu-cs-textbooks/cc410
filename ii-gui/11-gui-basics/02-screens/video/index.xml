    <title>Introduction :: CC 410 Textbook</title>

    <description>Resources Slides Video Script In this chapter, we’re going to look at how we can create graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, for our programs. Thankfully, the technology and frameworks we have available today have greatly simplified this process, but it is still worth looking back at some historical information first, just to get a sense of how things have changed over the years. For example, this slide shows the various standard screen resolutions that have been used on computer systems over the years. In the textbook, we discuss how resolutions such as VGA, or 640 by 480 pixels, were popular in the late 1980s, up through XGA, or 1024 by 768 pixels, which was dominant up through the start of the 2010s. Today, there are a wide variety of resolutions that are commonly used, but it is also very common for users to no longer just use applications in “full screen” mode, so our applications really could be expected to work for a variety of screen sizes.</description>
