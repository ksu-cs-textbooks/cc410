    <title>Java Swing :: CC 410 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Materials&#xA;Now let’s dive into Java Swing and see how to make our very first GUI application in Swing.&#xA;Imports At the top of our applications, we’ll need to import elements from three different packages:&#xA;import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; import javax.swing.*; The java.awt package includes all of the classes related to the older Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) in Java, and the java.swing package includes all newer Java Swing packages. Instead of reinventing the wheel, Java Swing reuses many components from AWT, such as the Dimension class that is used to control the size and position of windows. We also include the java.awt.event package to handle events such as button clicks.</description>
