    <description>Content Note Portions of the content in this chapter was adapted from Nathan Bean’s CIS 400 course at K-State, with the author’s permission. That content is licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.&#xA;This chapter will introduce concepts related to building a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced “gooey”) for our programs. Up to this point, all of our program interaction has been done either through the terminal or via input files. Most non-technical users today, however, are unfamiliar with using the terminal and prefer to interact with programs graphically. So, as developers, we should learn how to build our programs in a way that they are accessible to a wide audience of users.</description>
