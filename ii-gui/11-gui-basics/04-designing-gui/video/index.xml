    <title>GUI Design :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/11-gui-basics/04-designing-gui/video/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Let’s talk a bit about how to design user interfaces in our programs. First and foremost, I want to make it clear that this class is NOT a user interface design class, nor am I a particular expert on good user interface design. Instead, we are mainly focused on learning how to build the interfaces and make them functional, with design left as a extra topic that you are welcome to explore as your time allows. Simply put, we could spend an entire semester just learning all of the intricate ways we can add design and style to modern GUIs, but we really want to focus on the code and functionality behind the scenes as much as possible. When in doubt, try to make your GUIs as simple and straightforward as possible, and learn from your users as they give you feedback.</description>
