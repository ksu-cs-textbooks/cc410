      <description>Developing new software can be a very time consuming task. Thankfully, it is very easy to share the code and resources from previously developed software, making it very simple for large numbers of programmers to collectively work together, sometimes completely indirectly, to solve a new problem.&#xA;In this chapter, we’re going to explore software libraries and how we can take advantage of easily reusable pieces of software to make our job as programmers even easier.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;The term software library can actually mean several things. In essence, a software library is a collection of resources that can be used by computer program, either while it is running or while it is being developed. As we’ve learned so far in this course, it makes sense to think of a large software program as a few smaller packages or subsystems that work together. With that view in mind, a software library simply is a subsystem or package that is developed outside of our application.</description>

      <description>There are many different types of software libraries available. However, many modern languages such as Java and Python have greatly simplified the task of using these libraries. This is because both Java and Python rely on an underlying program to execute our code (either the Java Runtime Environment, or JRE for Java, or the Python Interpreter for Python), which handles connecting our code to the various libraries available on our system.</description>

      <description>One question that comes up frequently when discussing software libraries is the difference between a library and a framework, as many times the terms are used interchangeably. So, let’s briefly explore the difference between the two and how they interact with each other.&#xA;1&#xA;Software Library As discussed on the previous page, a library is a reusable software component that has an API that we can make use of in our code.</description>

      <description>So far, we’ve learned about what software libraries are, and how they differ from other, similar tools such as software frameworks. However, you are probably wondering: “how do I find these libraries and add them to my application?” Let’s discuss the various places you can learn about software libraries and how to use them in your applications.&#xA;Repositories One of the most common ways to find software libraries to include in your application is to review the libraries available in a repository of libraries for your language.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Video Materials&#xA;In the world of software, we use the term open-source to refer to any software that has source code that is openly available. This is in contrast to proprietary software, sometimes referred to as closed-source software, which is software with source code that is not publicly available. The software itself may be sold, or even provided for free, but the actual source code is protected by the company.</description>

      <description>The use of software libraries can be complex, as seen in the earlier discussions in this chapter. There are licensing issues to consider, security issues to worry about, and even then we might struggle to find the library that best fits our needs. However, let’s take a step back and review why we should definitely still consider using these libraries wherever possible in our work.&#xA;Don’t Reinvent the Wheel The saying “don’t reinvent the wheel” is a good one to keep in mind when writing new software.</description>

      <description>Java typically uses a special type of file called a JAR file, short for “Java Archive” file, to create a downloadable package that may contain Java source code, compiled class files, and additional data. We can even include compiled Javadoc documentation directly in a JAR file.&#xA;Most software libraries for Java are distributed as JAR files, including from the major repositories such as Maven Central. In addition, most websites that offer direct downloading of Java libraries typically use the JAR file format.</description>

      <description>The Java programming language has many different libraries available for developers to use. Below is a list of some of the most common and useful libraries, as well as links for more information about each one. As we continue to develop more complex softwares, we may want to look at some of these libraries for additional information. We can also browse the repository at Maven Central for additional libraries we could use.</description>

      <description>Python typically uses a special type of file called a Wheel to create a downloadable package that contains Python source code and any additional resources or bundled libraries required for the package. Wheel files replaced the older “egg” file format that Python used for distribution.&#xA;Most software libraries for Python are distributed as wheel files, including from the major repositories such as PyPi.&#xA;A wheel file itself is built using the same format as the ZIP file format.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we learned about software libraries and how we can use them in our applications. We explored the different types of libraries, including static libraries, shared libraries, and class libraries. We discussed the differences between libraries and frameworks and how to tell the difference. We also covered repositories and how to search for and download helpful software packages we can use.&#xA;In addition, we discussed the various licenses that may be attached to software libraries we use in our code, and how that may impact our ability to license and distribute our software in the future.</description>
