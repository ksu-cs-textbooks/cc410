    <description>Resources Slides Video Script In this chapter, we’re going to look at how we can use external libraries within our own applications. One of the major mantras of most programmers is “don’t reinvent the wheel” and I feel that making ample use of good external libraries is the greatest example of that mantra put into practice. There are libraries out there for nearly any use, from parsing command-line arguments to interfacing with online APIs, that we can easily use. On this slide, we sees a quick diagram showing what it might look like for us to make use of a library for playing Ogg Vorbis files, an audio file format similar to an MP3. In our application, represented by the “program” box on the right, we include the library and then call its functions to use it. So, we can get the name of an Ogg file, and then send it to the library called “libvorbisfile” to help us read the file and turn it into an audio stream, which it will send back. So, the library is outside of our application’s code, but we can interact with it by passing messages, or calling functions, as defined by the publicly available API of the library.</description>
