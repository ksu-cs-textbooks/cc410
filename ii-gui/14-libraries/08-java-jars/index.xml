    <title>Java JARs :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/ii-gui/14-libraries/08-java-jars/</link>
    <description>Java typically uses a special type of file called a JAR file, short for “Java Archive” file, to create a downloadable package that may contain Java source code, compiled class files, and additional data. We can even include compiled Javadoc documentation directly in a JAR file.&#xA;Most software libraries for Java are distributed as JAR files, including from the major repositories such as Maven Central. In addition, most websites that offer direct downloading of Java libraries typically use the JAR file format.</description>
