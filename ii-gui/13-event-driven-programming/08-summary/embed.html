<p>In this chapter, we learned about <strong>event-driven programming</strong> and how to configure our GUI-based programs to respond to actions taken by the user.</p>
<p>When the user interacts with our GUI, an <strong>event</strong> is created by the operating system and placed in the <strong>event queue</strong>. Then, our program uses an <strong>event loop</strong> to check the queue for incoming events, and respond to them. When an event is found, our program determines if that event has been <strong>bound</strong> to a particular <strong>event handler</strong>, also known as a <strong>listener</strong> or <strong>callback</strong>. If so, it calls the appropriate function handle that event.</p>
<p>The <strong>event loop</strong> is typically run in a separate thread in our program, and we must make sure that any operations performed on that thread are quick enough to prevent any lag in our GUI.</p>
<p>In the example project for this chapter, we&rsquo;ll explore how to add some event handlers to our GUIs.</p>

# Event-driven Programming

The **event-driven programming** paradigm is best described by which statement?

1. [X] A program's execution order is determined by events
1. [ ] A program's execution follows linearly through the code
1. [ ] A program is constructed of logical rules converting inputs to outputs
1. [ ] A program is constructed of smaller parts like conditionals and iterative structures

# Event Handler

In event-driven programming, what is the purpose of an **event handler**? 

1. [X] Receives incoming events and determines which action to perform
1. [ ] Prevents the user from generating events until the current one is finished
1. [ ] Automatically generates events corresponding to GUI elements
1. [ ] Tells the operating system which events to generate

# Event Loop

Many event-driven programs use an **event loop**, which is responsible for what task?

1. [X] Continually checking for new events to be processed
1. [ ] Making sure the program has not hit deadlock
1. [ ] Sending a heartbeat message to the operating system
1. [ ] Executing the same event repeatedly

# Connecting

The act of connecting an event in the GUI to an event handler is known by what term?

1. [X] Binding
1. [ ] Linking
1. [ ] Attaching
1. [ ] Glueing

# Events

When a user interacts with a button on a GUI, what is the most likely event that will be generated?

1. [X] `Clicked`
1. [ ] `Resize`
1. [ ] `Key Released`
1. [ ] `Get Focus`

# Java Handlers

In Java Swing, we typically refer to event handlers by what name?

1. [X] Listeners
1. [ ] Callbacks
1. [ ] Integrators
1. [ ] Executors

# Python Handlers

In Python tkinter, we typically refer to event handlers by what name?

1. [ ] Listeners
1. [X] Callbacks
1. [ ] Integrators
1. [ ] Executors

# Event Queue

An **event queue** in event-driven programming is used for what purpose?

1. [X] To store events as they are generated until they can be handled
1. [ ] To keep track of any possible events supported by the GUI
1. [ ] To maintain a list of events that have been handled
1. [ ] To remember what the program was doing when an event is generated.

# Short Events

In the text, what reason is given for making sure that event handlers are short and execute quickly?

1. [X] The GUI screen cannot update while an event handler is running
1. [ ] Event handlers consume a large amount of memory
1. [ ] Event handlers must complete within 1/60th of a second or they will be terminated
1. [ ] The program might crash while waiting on input from the user

# Starting a Program

Both Java Swing and Python tkinter have a special way to start a GUI based program, which involves performing what task in our code?

1. [X] Starting the event loop
1. [ ] Clearing the screen
1. [ ] Registering the user
1. [ ] Handling the `Program Start` event
