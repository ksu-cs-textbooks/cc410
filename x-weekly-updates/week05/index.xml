    <title>Fall &#39;25 Week 5 :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/x-weekly-updates/week05/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CC410 in fall 2025. This week you should be wrapping up a module on inheritance and polymorphism and playing around with an example on inheritance. Also in this week, we’ve got a start, stop, continue survey, which I think is one of the really important things I want you to get through in this class. So please take a little bit to work on that. That just gives me some quick feedback on how things are going. And hopefully you’ve got a little time to work on the final project because we’re working on a two-week module. There’s going to be a little bit of gap in there. So hopefully you can start working on some final project time as well.</description>
