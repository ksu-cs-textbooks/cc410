<p>Hello and welcome to the Week 7 Announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. This week you&rsquo;ll be working on a module about test doubles, which I think are one of the most important parts in this class outside of the design patterns that you worked on previously. We&rsquo;ll be doing a restaurant milestone that implements a lot of these test doubles in unit tests, and you&rsquo;ll also be completing the first concept quiz. In the previous video I talked a little bit about the concept quiz. It&rsquo;s basically meant to check to see if you&rsquo;re understanding some of the deeper concepts we&rsquo;ve been covering in this class. It&rsquo;s open book, open notes. It is timed, so make sure you watch out for that. And I&rsquo;m really looking for you to do your own work. Please don&rsquo;t use tools like Chat GPT on the concept quiz. I really want to see how well you&rsquo;re understanding these deeper concepts because it really shows me that you&rsquo;re getting the concepts that we&rsquo;re covering in this class.</p>
<p>So the milestone you&rsquo;re going to work on is adding unit tests for the design patterns that we added to the restaurant in the previous milestone. You&rsquo;ll be using test doubles, so you&rsquo;ll be mocking a lot of these design patterns up. What I really tell you to do is focus on only testing one class. So whatever class you&rsquo;re testing, test that content, and then use test doubles to mock up all of the other classes that interact with it. If you do this correctly, it leads to a lot of more powerful unit tests for your project, which I think is really, really important in this class. Looking ahead after this, we&rsquo;re going to have this up, and then we&rsquo;ll switch over to working with graphical user interfaces here right around Spring Break. We&rsquo;ll spend some time talking about event-driven programming. I think everybody should have scheduled a meeting with me this week or next week to talk about your final project. And then after that, we&rsquo;ll kind of work on some stuff on external libraries, releases, web APIs, et cetera, as we get toward the end of the semester. So we&rsquo;re getting close to Spring Break. Hopefully things are going well. We&rsquo;re nearing that halfway point in the class, so hopefully things are going as good as you can. If you have any questions or concerns, let me know. Otherwise, I will see you again next week. Best of luck.</p>
