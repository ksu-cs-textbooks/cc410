      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week two announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2023. You&amp;rsquo;ll see me in these videos about once a week. They&amp;rsquo;re a little bit more informal. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice I don&amp;rsquo;t put up my background or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s a chance for me to talk through some things that I would normally say if we were in class at the beginning of class.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the Announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2023 on week three. So this week you should be wrapping up the second module, which is the first restaurant milestone, which is on object oriented programming. There&amp;rsquo;s a short example that you should do working with the short Little Sunday Shop. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget on that one, you need to actually create the second class yourself.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the Week 8 announcements video for CC410 in Fall 2023. My apologies for missing last week&amp;rsquo;s video. I was on the road three days last week and I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get the announcements done before it was too late for them to be relevant. But I&amp;rsquo;ll try and catch you up this week. So right now you should be wrapping up the module on Test Doubles, which is a really important concept in this class that allows you to do unit testing on classes that you&amp;rsquo;ve already written.</description>
