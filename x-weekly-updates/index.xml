      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to CC 410 Advanced Programming, the first week of the course in spring 2025. My name is Russell Feldhausen. I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is here on the screen. I work mostly remotely from the Kansas City area, so I’m not on campus very often. Generally, you can find me on campus on Mondays throughout the semester, although for the first couple of weeks of class, I’ll actually be on campus on Wednesdays.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week two announcements for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be wrapping up the first module, which is the Hello Real World project. It introduces some of the coding style and some of the things we’re going to use in this class. Thankfully, that project is mostly just a follow along with me on the videos project, so you should be getting that wrapped up today.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week three announcements video for CC410 in spring 2025. So you should have already wrapped up the second module which is on object oriented programming. We do a small example on object oriented programming where you make a few data classes and then you worked on the first big restaurant milestone where you made object oriented programming classes for each of the menu items in that restaurant itself.</description>

      <description>A Repeat Good morning! Unfortunately I’m not feeling very photogenic this morning so I won’t record a new announcements video. Instead, here is a repeat from last semester that has all the pertinent information about the upcoming milestone. Best of luck!&#xA;YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week four announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2024. So this week you should be wrapping up the second restaurant project milestone, which involves adding documentation, unit testing, and a UML diagram to your project.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week five announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2025. My apologies for not being here last week. I was under the weather, but hopefully last year’s video worked out really well. So this week you’re going to be wrapping up a module on inheritance and polymorphism. You did a small example exploring inheritance using a blender and a bunch of fruit.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the Week 7 Announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. This week you’ll be working on a module about test doubles, which I think are one of the most important parts in this class outside of the design patterns that you worked on previously. We’ll be doing a restaurant milestone that implements a lot of these test doubles in unit tests, and you’ll also be completing the first concept quiz.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the Week 8 announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. So this week you should be wrapping up the module on test doubles. I believe most everybody already has that submitted, so that’s great. That module builds really nicely on the previous module working with design patterns. And so those two modules kind of go together. I’ll work on getting caught up on grading those now that I’m back from my conference.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week nine announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2025. So last week you worked on adding a basic user interface to your program and this week we’re going to work on parallel programming and event driven programming so we can actually add events to your user interface so that when you click on the buttons they will actually do something.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week 10 announcements for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on an example of bringing in an external library into our project. We’re just gonna do a small example for how to do that. Then you’re gonna get started on the eighth restaurant milestone where we’re gonna add orders and combos. This is also another instance of the Start, Stop, Continue survey.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the Week 12 Announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. As promised, this week we’re going to shift gears from building a traditional desktop user interface to start building a web user interface. So this week we’re going to start talking about data-driven websites. You’ll go through a quick example to install a website framework on top of your existing project, and you’ll do that in your restaurant project as well.</description>
