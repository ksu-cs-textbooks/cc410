      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to CC 410 Advanced Programming, the first week of the course in spring 2025. My name is Russell Feldhausen. I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is here on the screen. I work mostly remotely from the Kansas City area, so I’m not on campus very often. Generally, you can find me on campus on Mondays throughout the semester, although for the first couple of weeks of class, I’ll actually be on campus on Wednesdays.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week two announcements for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be wrapping up the first module, which is the Hello Real World project. It introduces some of the coding style and some of the things we’re going to use in this class. Thankfully, that project is mostly just a follow along with me on the videos project, so you should be getting that wrapped up today.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week three announcements video for CC410 in spring 2025. So you should have already wrapped up the second module which is on object oriented programming. We do a small example on object oriented programming where you make a few data classes and then you worked on the first big restaurant milestone where you made object oriented programming classes for each of the menu items in that restaurant itself.</description>

      <description>A Repeat Good morning! Unfortunately I’m not feeling very photogenic this morning so I won’t record a new announcements video. Instead, here is a repeat from last semester that has all the pertinent information about the upcoming milestone. Best of luck!&#xA;Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week four announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2024. So this week you should be wrapping up the second restaurant project milestone, which involves adding documentation, unit testing, and a UML diagram to your project.</description>
