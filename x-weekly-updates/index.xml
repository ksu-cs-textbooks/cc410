      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to week two of CC 410 in spring 2023. So today you should be wrapping up module one, which includes the Hello real world project. And it also includes the first final project meeting. So if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that already, please schedule a time to meet with me via Calendly. Over the next week or so, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk a little bit about the final project in this class, it gives us a chance to get to know each other, and it opens up that line of communication as you work on your final project throughout the rest of the semester.</description>
