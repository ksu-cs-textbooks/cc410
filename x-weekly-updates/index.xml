      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week one announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2022. My name is Russ, I&amp;rsquo;ll be your instructor for the semester, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably post these announcements videos about once a week, usually on Tuesdays since I&amp;rsquo;m on campus on Mondays and won&amp;rsquo;t have time to record them. So you can check Canvas about every Tuesday to get a quick update for me on what you&amp;rsquo;re doing this week and anything else that&amp;rsquo;s on my mind.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week two announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2022. So you should be wrapping up module one this week, which includes the Hello real world project and the first final project meeting. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that already, please take a minute to schedule a time to meet with me using my Calendly link. So we can talk about the final project in this class and just answer any questions you might have about what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week three announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2022. This week you should be wrapping up module two, which is all about object oriented programming. You&amp;rsquo;ve also got a quick example on object oriented programming. And you&amp;rsquo;re also going to be diving deep into the first restaurant milestone. Hopefully all of that is going well. But if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to let me know.</description>

And then the second restaurant milestone is all about adding a lot of unit tests and documentation directly to the code that you wrote for the first milestone.</description>

You also should have gotten the start stop continue survey, I&amp;rsquo;ve received several responses already. And I&amp;rsquo;ve responded to some of those in an announcement on Canvas.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week seven announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2022, this week, we&amp;rsquo;re going to switch gears a little bit and spend some time working on both parallel programming and event driven programming, a couple of different paradigms that you&amp;rsquo;ve maybe seen before, but you haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with a little bit. So this will be some really good examples that you can work through.</description>
