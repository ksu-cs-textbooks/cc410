      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to week two of CC 410 in spring 2023. So today you should be wrapping up module one, which includes the Hello real world project. And it also includes the first final project meeting. So if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that already, please schedule a time to meet with me via Calendly. Over the next week or so, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk a little bit about the final project in this class, it gives us a chance to get to know each other, and it opens up that line of communication as you work on your final project throughout the rest of the semester.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week eight announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2023, so this week, you should be wrapping up the module on test doubles and mock objects, which is one of the other new units we&amp;rsquo;ve added this semester. You also should have met with me last week probably for the final project. And then you should have completed the first concept quiz in this class, which was due late last week.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week nine Announcements video for CC 410 In spring 2023. This week we&amp;rsquo;re going to go through a couple of different examples. The first one is about parallel programming, which is an important concept for us to learn when working with user interfaces. We&amp;rsquo;ll also do an example around event driven programming, which allows us to make our interfaces interactive.</description>
