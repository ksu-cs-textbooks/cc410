<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 12 Announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2021. So this week, we&rsquo;ll be pivoting from working on our graphical user interfaces to starting working on the web. And so the example this week, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to web frameworks and how you can build data driven websites using the same set of code that we&rsquo;ve been using throughout this semester. So we&rsquo;ll do a quick example on that. And then you&rsquo;ll actually implement a website in your project itself. This first project will just work on setting up the routes following the web MVC kind of RESTful architecture. And then from here on out, we&rsquo;ll add some features to that. So you can add custom menu items via the web. At this point, we&rsquo;re also getting down to the last four weeks of the semester. So you should definitely start working on your final project if you haven&rsquo;t already. And this is really the time to start getting a lot of the code done. We&rsquo;ve got two weeks to do, we have Thanksgiving, and then we have two weeks. And that&rsquo;s pretty much it. So keep that in mind that things are going to move pretty quickly from here on out.</p>
<p>So like I said, for this restaurant milestone, you&rsquo;ll install a web framework into your project, you&rsquo;ll set up some routes in the controller, you&rsquo;ll also learn a little bit about templating, and how you can set a master template and some route templates. And really, the goal is to build a website menu that is data driven based on all of the data that we have in our class. A quick little aside on this in an actual practical website, you would probably use a database to store all the data about your menu instead of classes and objects like we&rsquo;re using so far. However, databases are really outside of the scope of what I&rsquo;m going to cover in this class. So we&rsquo;ll learn how to do it using the existing objects and everything that we have. But understand that in actuality, you would probably use a database for this in the real world. And so those of you that are in the ICS program, you&rsquo;ll go on to take our databases course. And you&rsquo;ll learn how you can actually add a database to this, you can also take our web development course, which actually teaches you how to build data driven websites using a real database. So this is kind of a primer to some of that, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually get you the full experience.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&rsquo;re going to talk a little bit more about form data and filtering and how we can build web forms to collect data from the users. We&rsquo;ll also talk a little bit about serialization. The big thing to know is from here on out, the milestones will be much smaller, about half the size of the earlier milestones about a quarter of the size of the last two milestones. And the whole idea is to give you more time to work on your final project for these last few weeks. Also, keep in mind that the last restaurant milestone will be due on December 13. That&rsquo;s the Monday of finals week, although you&rsquo;ll have until the Friday of finals week to get everything wrapped up and turned in on this class before the end of the semester. So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at at week 12. Hopefully you&rsquo;re getting ready to pivot to working with the World Wide Web. As always, if you have any questions let me know and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
