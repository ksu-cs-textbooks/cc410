<p>Hello, and welcome to the week five video for CC 410 in Fall 2021. So this week, you should be wrapping up the third module, which is all on inheritance and polymorphism. And starting to work on refactoring your code to take advantage of some of that. So right now, the chapter on inheritance and polymorphism is due. And the example is due. The next milestone, which is milestone three is not due until next week, so you&rsquo;ve got an extra week to work on that. But things I&rsquo;d like you to work on is, make sure you fill out the start, stop, continue survey, and also start thinking about your final project a little bit, it might be still too early to start working on the code. But hopefully, you can start thinking about ideas and looking at the class structure we built for the restaurant project, and thinking about how that class structure might adapt to whatever final project you&rsquo;re interested in doing.</p>
<p>This week, you should be working on debugging and logging, which is a really important concept. We&rsquo;re also going to talk a little bit about lambda expressions, which are really important for some of the unit testing that you&rsquo;ll need to be doing. So for next week, you&rsquo;ll be working on a debugging logging example. And you&rsquo;ll be working on the third restaurant milestone which is refactoring your code to take advantage of inheritance and polymorphism. Also, on October 1, you&rsquo;ll have the second final project meeting that should be scheduled. However, in just a second, I&rsquo;m going to talk about some scheduling that might impact exactly when you want to get that done.</p>
<p>So for milestone three, this is the first milestone that we require all the general requirements. So make sure you have your code unit tested, have your documentation. And this time we&rsquo;ll be enforcing the style guide. So make sure that your code passes the style checker completely. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any issues in your code. As far as the style checker is concerned. You&rsquo;ll be adding some new unit tests, you&rsquo;ll be updating your UML diagram. Thankfully, since this is mostly refactoring, you should only be working on about a 1500 lines of code, it&rsquo;ll be a little bit smaller than your previous milestones. But it will be a lot more in depth the work that you&rsquo;re actually doing to update this milestone.</p>
<p>So some big hints for this milestone, just like every other milestone, try and work in small chunks, get a short little bit working; commit early commit often. Remember that you can use GitHub to roll back. This is also the first milestone where you could try test driven development. As you&rsquo;re working on code, you could try writing your unit tests first, and then building the code so that it will actually beat those unit tests that will actually fulfill them. I also have a hint that it&rsquo;s not in the assignment. But it&rsquo;s a big hint that you can actually inherit the order item interface on your base classes. So pizza drink and side, instead of inheriting it directly in all of the subclasses of that. It&rsquo;s a little bit different infrastructure, but I think it actually works better. And also this, this particular milestone your work on some new and improved syntax. So if you have any questions on syntax, especially in Python, but maybe also in Java, feel free to let me know and ask those questions. And I&rsquo;d be happy to answer ways to do that. This especially comes in with a style checker. Sometimes making the style checker in Python happy requires some weird syntax to wrap your lines. So make sure you keep that in mind.</p>
<p>An update on the schedule. I will be on vacation from October 1 to October the 10th. So that is a week from Friday through the following weekend. During that time, I&rsquo;ll be on the road a lot. So I will have limited access to email and Discord. I will try and check in about once a day and answer what I can. But I may not be as quick at answering. Because of that the grading for milestone four might be delayed. Milestone four is still due the Monday that I&rsquo;m gone. But it might take me a little bit time to get to that. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s mostly just getting your GUI up and running. So there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of code there. It&rsquo;s mostly just building your GUI, so you kind of know if it works or doesn&rsquo;t. Based on previous semesters, with that milestone, I expect minimal questions. But if there&rsquo;s a lot of questions or a lot of confusion, I may adjust the due dates on either milestone four or five, if needed, just to give me enough time to answer those questions. So we&rsquo;ll kind of play it by ear, I&rsquo;ll do the best I can to stay in contact while I&rsquo;m on the road. But if things happen, I will do my best to make sure that it&rsquo;s fair and equitable for everybody involved.</p>
<p>So looking ahead from there, after this milestone, we&rsquo;ll start switching over to graphical user interfaces. So we&rsquo;ll spend some modules learning about GUIs, Event Driven Programming, we&rsquo;ll spend a lot of time talking about design patterns and how we can use that to implement combos and orders in our system. And then we&rsquo;ll start talking about external libraries and then get into things like web API&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So hopefully, this is a really good week. It&rsquo;s hopefully the last warm week of the summer. So if you&rsquo;re starting to feel the heat, I&rsquo;m hoping that by the end of today, it&rsquo;ll start getting a little cooler outside it&rsquo;ll start feeling more like fall. As always, if you have any questions on your work as you work on these milestones, feel free to let me know I&rsquo;m always available. You can catch me on discord by email or at tea time or you can schedule one on one office hours with me using calendly. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing your code and good luck this week.</p>

<h1 id="update-to-example-5-python">Update to Example 5 Python</h1>

<p>It appears that I missed an interesting error when developing Example 5 for Python. It is a bit complex, so I&rsquo;m relying on the advanced formatting of this webpage to help explain it better than I can via email or in a short post to the class. I&rsquo;ll start with a short version, and then include a longer discussion of the problem and how I came to a solution that I feel is very helpful reading for anyone learning to program and solve these issues in their own work.</p>
<h2 id="tldr---the-short-version">tl;dr - The Short Version</h2>
<p>Currently pytest has a <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" rel="external" target="_blank">bug</a> that causes errors when logging to <code>sys.stderr</code> when running code inside of <code>pytest</code>.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, <code>pytest</code> tries to capture all output being printed to <code>sys.stderr</code> by redirecting it to a buffer (a virtual file) when running the tests. Once it is done, it will close the buffer and redirect output back to <code>sys.stderr</code>. Unfortunately, our logger does not realize this, and it may continue to try and write data to the buffer that is now closed, resulting in the <code>ValueError: I/O operation on closed file</code> error message seen in the output.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session/44595269#44595269" rel="external" target="_blank">methods</a> to determine if code is running under <code>pytest</code> and disable logging in that case.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" rel="external" target="_blank">this method</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">logger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getLogger</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># disable if pytest is running</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="s2">&#34;pytest&#34;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">modules</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">disabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>You will need to add this code to any file that you add logging to, in order to prevent errors from <code>pytest</code>. Alternatively, you can disable the handler that prints to <code>sys.stderr</code> and instead just use a file handler.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>
<p>Since this is an advanced programming course, I figure that it is worth a bit of a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into this situation so you can understand what I found, the efforts I went through to solve it, and how things are really working behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This is a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" rel="external" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, where I attempt to show you my thought processes and how I go about solving a problem like this. My hope is that you&rsquo;ll be able to learn from this process and possibly use this knowledge to help you solve your own problems in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the world of higher education, we spend way too much time focusing on narrowly-scoped, previously-solved problems, to allow you to learn in an environment where we know a solution is possible in a set amount of time. In the real world, however, you&rsquo;ll be constantly presented with broadly-scoped, open-ended problems like this one, where you&rsquo;ll have to do some exploration to find possible causes and solutions, and then use your own background and knowledge to determine what solutions, if any, are available.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<h3 id="the-error">The Error</h3>
<p>When you run <code>pytest</code> in Example 5 after adding some logging code as directed in the video, you will see many pages of errors printed to the terminal. In my testing, the terminal in Codio printed errors for several minutes before finally stopping. A screenshot of a small portion of those errors is below.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d4e9d2b31074b008dc63976c49ed25e0" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Errors" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc410/images/e5/410_e5_errors.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-d4e9d2b31074b008dc63976c49ed25e0"><img alt="Errors" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc410/images/e5/410_e5_errors.png"></a></p>
<p>When this happens, you may be able to use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the output, but in many cases I simply had to close the terminal tab in Codio.</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>When I developed this example, I focused on the debugging portion first, and then later added the logging code. However, I neglected to run <code>pytest</code> after adding the logging code to my model solution, and did not encounter this error in my initial testing. That was an oversight on my part.</p>
<p>As you work on this project, you may end up adding the logging code first while still working on debugging the errors in the project. In that case, you will most likely run <code>tox</code> or <code>pytest</code> to run the unit tests contained in the project with the logging code in place. That will cause the error to appear. As soon as I ran <code>tox</code> in my existing model solution, my code presented this error.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-solved-the-problem">How I solved the problem</h3>
<p>The process of finding a solution for this problem went in three phases.</p>
<h6 id="phase-1---searching">Phase 1 - Searching</h6>
<p>First, I attempted to Google some of the error message and a few things that I suspected were at play. I already had a hunch that the error itself was coming from the logging code, since I had added that to my model solution last. After reproducing the bug in my solution, I set out to solve it. Some Google search phrases I used:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pytest logging stderr write to closed file</code> - Including keywords <code>pytest</code> and <code>logging</code> as well as the <code>stderr</code> stream and a bit of the error message.</li>
<li><code>pytest stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - adding more details such as the line of code causing the error and the exact error messages.</li>
<li><code>&quot;pytest&quot; stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - putting <code>&quot;pytest&quot;</code> in quotes will find results that always include that keyword</li>
</ol>
<p>There were others, but this was the most fruitful.</p>
<h6 id="phase-2---isolate-the-error">Phase 2 - Isolate the Error</h6>
<p>In several of those searches, I came across a few bug reports on GitHub, specifically within the <code>pytest</code> project&rsquo;s repository. Bug reports and discussions on GitHub are usually very fruitful when looking for technical errors that include code and error messages, so I looked into a few of them.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/14" rel="external" target="_blank">ValueError: I/O Operation on closed file (#14)</a> - this was the first one I found. However, I quickly ruled it out, as it was first posted in 2010 and mainly seemed to use Python 2 instead of Python 3. After scrolling through the discussion, nothing really seemed to fit the situation I was in, so I ignored it and moved on. However, it did reference the next issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5743" rel="external" target="_blank">Improve error message when tests use closed stdout/stderr (capture) (#5743)</a> - this one felt like it was a bit closer. In this report, they discuss the fact that pytest will redirect and close system streams such as <code>sys.stderr</code> as part of the test. It was also much more recent, and some of the error messages they were running into were similar to what I was seeing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5282" rel="external" target="_blank">pytest 4.5 floods the output with logging errors when logging from atexit handlers (#5282)</a> - similar to the one above, this one was getting closer to the issue I was seeing, though it wasn&rsquo;t an exact match. By reading these three thread, I was starting to get a feel for the crux of the error - if our logger is trying to write to any of the output streams, like <code>sys.stderr</code> or <code>sys.stdout</code>, then most likely <code>pytest</code> would interfere with that and cause this error. Thankfully, the last two issues both referenced this issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" rel="external" target="_blank">pytest capture logging error still happening (#5502)</a> - this report had a lot of discussion on it, but pretty much sealed the deal for me. One of the core <code>pytest</code> developers posted <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502#issuecomment-526348052" rel="external" target="_blank">a message</a> that included this text:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What I believe is happening is:</p>
<ol>
<li>pytest changes <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to a buffer while importing test modules.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s user code setting up logging and/or creating a <code>logging.StreamHandler</code> at the import level, it will attach itself to pytest&rsquo;s buffer.</li>
<li>When pytest is about to finish the test session, it will restore <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to the original values, and close the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; buffer.</li>
<li>Here the problem happens: if any message is emitted at this point, the <code>StreamHandler</code> will try to attach itself to the buffer, hence the error.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve now found what we suspect is the error. All we have to do is figure out how to resolve it.</p>
<h6 id="phase-3---the-fix">Phase 3 - The Fix</h6>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" rel="external" target="_blank">issue #5502</a> is still open as of this writing, so we needed a way to get around this error. With some quick testing, I was able to confirm the error went away if I removed the <code>StreamHandler</code> from the existing logging code. So, I decided that the best way to deal with this was to find some way to disable logging while the code is running as part of a unit test. This is a somewhat common, though discouraged, trick in programming. Ideally you don&rsquo;t want to hide any code from the unit tests, but in some instances you want to make sure that the unit tests don&rsquo;t actually change live data, such as the actual database used by this program. So, you can &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the code that connects to the database and make sure it cannot run as part of a unit test.</p>
<p>A quick Google search for <code>determine if code is running under pytest python</code> quickly lead me to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session" rel="external" target="_blank">StackOverflow post</a> discussing this very issue. Great! I had quickly found a pretty good resource that might lead me to a solution.</p>
<p>Within the discussion, there are a few solutions suggested, and helpfully ranked by the upvotes from other users.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" rel="external" target="_blank">Solution 1</a> - simply check <code>if &quot;pytest&quot; in sys.modules:</code> since the <code>pytest</code> application will always be loaded when running a test. This solution seemed pretty simple and didn&rsquo;t have many obvious side effects, provided your application didn&rsquo;t load <code>pytest</code> as part of its normal execution.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25188424" rel="external" target="_blank">Solution 2</a> - a solution that points to a section of the <a href="http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#detect-if-running-from-within-a-pytest-run" rel="external" target="_blank">pytest Manual</a> that shows the preferred way of doing this. In short, we place some code in the <code>conftest.py</code> file, which is only executed as part of a unit test, to update a value in our code, and then check that value where needed. This looks promising, and is probably the correct answer that would work in all cases, but also requires significantly more code and adds a structural dependency between our code and the <code>conftest.py</code> file.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58866220" rel="external" target="_blank">Solution 3</a> - a third solution suggests checking for the existence of the <code>PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST</code> environment variable, which is set when pytest is running. This may also work, but has the side effect of being outside of our control - any other application on our system could also set that variable, including another instance of <code>pytest</code>, so it may not work as reliably as the other two.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I chose <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" rel="external" target="_blank">Solution 1</a>, and updated the code at the top of my <code>main()</code> method in <code>TicTacToe.py</code> to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># get the root logger</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">logger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getLogger</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># disable if pytest is running</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="s2">&#34;pytest&#34;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">modules</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">disabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That code will simply load the logger, and immediately check if the <code>&quot;pytest&quot;</code> module is loaded. If so, it will disable the logger globally in my program.</p>
<p>An alternative solution would be to just disable the <code>StreamHandler</code> and allow the <code>FileHandler</code> to remain enabled, but I felt that logging from unit tests is not helpful and chose to disable it entirely.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I hope this discussion is helpful - I&rsquo;ve found that sometimes the best opportunities for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" rel="external" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a> happen directly as a result of the class, so I wanted to take this chance and share a bit of my own problem solving process here.</p>
