<p>Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2022. You get to see me in my professional recording setup because I&rsquo;m recording some videos today for CC 110. And I figured I&rsquo;d do some videos for CC 410 as well.</p>
<p>So this week, you should be wrapping up module four, which is all about inheritance and polymorphism. There&rsquo;s also an example project that you&rsquo;re going through, and you should have a start stop continue survey to fill out, please do fill out that survey, I do get some really good feedback from that. And I&rsquo;m working on trying to adapt some of the things that you asked me to start those of you that have already filled out the survey. So watch for that over the couple weeks. And then also this week, you should also spend a little bit of time thinking about your final project and some of the topics you might want to take on, because we&rsquo;ll have a meeting about that in the next week or so.</p>
<p>So this week, it&rsquo;s part of a double module where you&rsquo;ll be continuing to work on new content this week on debugging, logging, and lambda expressions. And that will feed into the work that you&rsquo;re doing on the third restaurant project, which is all about re-implementing some of the architecture and adding some inheritance and polymorphism to the entire structure. You&rsquo;re also going to be adding a bit more unit testing to confirm that your structure is correct. And then sometime next week, you&rsquo;ll also need to meet with me for the second final project milestone. This is the one where we try and actually tie down your final project topic for later this semester.</p>
<p>So quick reminder on milestone three. I talked about this a little bit last week. Basically, this week, all the general requirements will be enforced. So you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your unit tests are there, you need to make sure all your code is documented. I don&rsquo;t necessarily care about documentation on your unit tests. But all of your other code should be fully documented. That includes every class, every method, including getters and setters, and having all the arguments and returns and throws keywords anything in there that needs to be covered. You&rsquo;re also going to be adding inheritance this week. So make sure inheritance is correct. Make sure your code passes all of the style checkers. If you&rsquo;re in Python, make sure it passes the Mypy type checking and also make sure that has a pretty high level of coverage of your unit tests. You&rsquo;ll also need to update your UML diagram. This time, you&rsquo;re going to add some associations in your diagram between all the different inheritance classes. This milestone it&rsquo;s only about 1500 lines of code, but it is rather robust because of all the changes that you&rsquo;re making to your structure. So be careful with it. Feedback is always welcome. If there&rsquo;s anything that I can explain a little bit clearer in the assignment description itself. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to let me know if something&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>For this milestone, some big hints, work in small chunks, don&rsquo;t try and do everything in one shot. So pick one item that you&rsquo;re going to work on, get it working, and then commit to git so that you&rsquo;ve got that working, you can always commit often and go backwards if you need to. This is also a good chance to try test driven development, you can actually write your unit tests first, and then work on your code until you pass those unit tests. I also really recommend that you inherit the interface, I believe it&rsquo;s an item or order item interfaces, what I named it the semester, you should inherit that on your base classes instead of on each individual item on the menu. That makes it much easier for you to manage later on down the road. And don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions about syntax. There are some strange syntax things, especially with the unit tests on this one. So if you get stuck, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions.</p>
<p>So looking ahead from here after this week, when you turn in this milestone, we&rsquo;ll switch over to start working on GUIs and graphical user interfaces. So we&rsquo;ll spend the next few weeks working on that some things around event-driven programming. And then in module eight, we&rsquo;re going to introduce design patterns, which I think is the other big topic to cover in this class is design patterns. So we&rsquo;ll cover that and then from there, we&rsquo;ll go into libraries releases, web API&rsquo;s, etc.</p>
<p>So hopefully everything&rsquo;s going well for you. It&rsquo;s mid February at this point, so it&rsquo;s still kind of cold outside but it&rsquo;s starting to get warmer as you keep working on this project. As always, if you have any questions you can reach me on Discord you can email the cc410-help email address. Either way, I&rsquo;d be happy to help with you and I look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks and talking about your final projects.</p>
