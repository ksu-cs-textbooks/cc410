      <title>Update to Example 5 Python</title>

      <description>It appears that I missed an interesting error when developing Example 5 for Python. It is a bit complex, so I&amp;rsquo;m relying on the advanced formatting of this webpage to help explain it better than I can via email or in a short post to the class. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a short version, and then include a longer discussion of the problem and how I came to a solution that I feel is very helpful reading for anyone learning to program and solve these issues in their own work.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Edited Transcript Hi, everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can break the record for quickest turnaround on responses to a question that I got. But I did get a question via the start-stop-continue survey about loading the milestone content on Codio, so that you can see it on a single monitor, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using a laptop. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you a couple of things that you can do in Codio to to help out.</description>
