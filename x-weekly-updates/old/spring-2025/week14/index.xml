    <title>Spring &#39;25 Week 14 :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/x-weekly-updates/old/spring-2025/week14/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week 14 announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2025. This week you should be working on your fourth final project milestone. So you’ll be scheduling some time to meet with me either this week or next week to talk about your final project. There’s also the second concept quiz that’s out there. So make sure you’re looking at that and getting that done. And then there’s also a restaurant milestone and an example about using a RESTful API to be able to add and edit custom menu items to the project. And then of course, make sure you keep spending some time working on your final project. There’s a lot of different things to balance this week, but hopefully you’re finding time to get all of these things done as you get toward the end of the semester. So for the next restaurant milestone, we’re going to be building a RESTful web application that allows us to create custom menu items. We’re gonna reinforce some of the design patterns that we saw earlier this semester, such as the iterator pattern and the singleton pattern. And this is really the last time that you’re going to go through and update your UML diagram to match everything that you have going on in your web application.</description>
