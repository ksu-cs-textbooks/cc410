    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week 11 announcements for CC 410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on a milestone on releases where we’re going to actually take our project and build a release version of it that we can share out with others across the internet. This is kind of the last big wrap up part of this whole GUI process that we’ve been going through. And so for the ninth restaurant milestone, you’ll be finishing the checkout process using the external cash register library that you’ve installed and also printing a receipt so that everything comes together and we have a fully working point of sale system for our project.</description>
