<p>Hello and welcome to the week 13 announcements video for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on building a small RESTful API and building some web forms so that you can add custom menu items to your menu. We&rsquo;re going to store those in a separate list from the classes that actually store the real menu items but it gives you an idea of what it might look like to have a web app that actually allows you to add custom menu items to our list. So you&rsquo;re going to do a quick example around that and keep working on restaurant milestones for those. As before, these restaurant milestones are going to be smaller to give you more time to work on your final project, which remember that&rsquo;s coming up very soon.</p>
<p>So like I said, milestone 11 is all about adding web forms and search results and presenting those results through your web application. So it&rsquo;s a really nice way to actually play around with your application and make it a little bit more useful for your users. Other than that, we&rsquo;re going to start adding some RESTful API content and giving you a lot of time to work on your final project. Remember that&rsquo;s coming up in about three weeks. In the last restaurant milestone will also be new finals week. It&rsquo;s a very minimal milestone where we add some serialization to the project as well. So just be aware of that, that that&rsquo;s coming up. But other than the final project and the restaurant milestone, there are no other finals exams or anything in this class, just those milestones.</p>
<p>So looking ahead, we&rsquo;re looking toward the end of the semester. It&rsquo;s only three weeks to go. So make sure you&rsquo;re getting stuff wrapped up. As always, if you have questions, let me know. Otherwise, best of luck this week and I will see you again next week.</p>
