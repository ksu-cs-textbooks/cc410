    <description>A Repeat Good morning! I am travelling this week and won’t be able to record a new announcements video. Instead, here is a repeat from last semester that has all the pertinent information about the upcoming milestone. Best of luck!&#xA;Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week six announcements video for CC410 in fall 2024. So this week you should be wrapping up the modules on debugging, logging and Lambda expressions. There’s a small example that you do on debugging and logging and then the third restaurant milestone is due pretty soon. So make sure you get that done. You also should be scheduling your second final project meeting with me. So I look forward to hearing about some of your interests and things that you’re looking at for your final project. This is again, just a quick discussion to see where you’re at on project planning and maybe give you some advice of things that you could start working on in your final project as you have some time over the next few weeks.</description>
