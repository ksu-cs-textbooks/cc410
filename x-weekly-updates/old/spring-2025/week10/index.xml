    <title>Spring &#39;25 Week 10 :: CC 410 Textbook</title>

    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week 10 announcements for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on an example of bringing in an external library into our project. We’re just gonna do a small example for how to do that. Then you’re gonna get started on the eighth restaurant milestone where we’re gonna add orders and combos. This is also another instance of the Start, Stop, Continue survey. So it’s a good chance for you to give me any feedback that you have on things that are either going well in the class, things you want me to start doing, stop doing, or things you wanna make sure that I continue doing in the class. This is another just good informal anonymous check-in to see how things are going.</description>
