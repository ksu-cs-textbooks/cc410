    <title>Spring &#39;25 Week 15 :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/x-weekly-updates/old/spring-2025/week15/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week 15 announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on the last couple of things in this class where we’re going to talk about some form validation and some serialization. You’ll do a quick example about that and then you’ll add that to your restaurant milestone. Other than that, keep working on your final project. This is really the last restaurant milestone and then you’ll have a couple of weeks to wrap up your final project. I believe I met with most all of you last week about your final project, so hopefully that’s all going well.</description>
