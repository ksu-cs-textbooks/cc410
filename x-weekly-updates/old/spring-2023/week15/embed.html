<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 15 Announcements video for CC 410 In spring 2023. So recently, you should have completed the second concept quiz in this class, which goes over a lot of the stuff that we&rsquo;ve learned in the second half of the class, you also should have completed the rest example. And you should have completed the 12th restaurant milestone, which is about adding a RESTful API into your project itself. So next week, there are a couple of more things due there is the form validation example. And there&rsquo;s a last milestone on validation and serialization. So hopefully, you can get that done pretty quickly. That&rsquo;s due next week. And then by the end of finals week, which is on May 12. The only thing that&rsquo;s really left to do then is the final project. So make sure you&rsquo;re working on that.</p>
<p>For your final project. Some quick updates, don&rsquo;t forget that the things you need to submit Are you need to create a release tag on GitHub for your project, just like we do for everything else. Please make sure you read the requirements page for your final project and make sure that it meets all of those requirements. Your final project should have code documentation just like everything else. So all your functions should be documented, your file should be documented all of the stuff that we expect in this class you should be doing on your final project. I also recommend creating either a readme or some sort of user documentation to explain how the project works, how to run it, how to use it. And then of course, you&rsquo;ll do a presentation.</p>
<p>So the presentation itself should be about 30 minutes, you can either pre record your presentation, and then send me the video or you can present it live. But either way, you have to schedule a time with me to meet for q&amp;a. So if you pre record your video, you&rsquo;ll send it to me, I&rsquo;ll watch the video, and then we&rsquo;ll meet on Zoom to have some q&amp;a afterwards. On finals week, I&rsquo;m busy on campus may 9 10th and 11th with the senior projects for computer science. So for this class, the only two days I can do presentations, and Q and A&rsquo;s are either may 8, Monday or may 12 on Friday of finals week, you can go ahead and schedule those times right now using my Calendly link. So make sure you do that. But please make sure you get on the schedule soon. And let me know if you&rsquo;re going to either present live or if you&rsquo;re going to send me a video beforehand. And then we&rsquo;ll do some q&amp;a During our meeting time.</p>
<p>For your final project presentation. Here&rsquo;s a quick suggested outline that I recommend using the introduction and background are pretty self explanatory. Just tell us about your project and where the idea came from. Background. You might also include any inspiration or any related work that you&rsquo;ve seen, your implementation is going through the design in the code of your project itself, you can actually switch over and show some of the code for your project. Evaluation is evaluating how well your project met the goals how well it runs. And then you&rsquo;ll give some future work some things that you want to continue working on. If you could work on this project some more, you&rsquo;ll give me a quick conclusion. And then you&rsquo;ll demo your project. So make sure you&rsquo;re prepared to run and demo your project. However you need to do that, because I&rsquo;ll have you walk through it. And then we&rsquo;ll go through some q&amp;a.</p>
<p>Finally, the last big thing there are Tevals in this class. So make sure you&rsquo;re watching for that t values should be emailed to you on finals week. And you&rsquo;ll get a couple of reminders to complete them as well. Don&rsquo;t forget teaching evaluations at K State are anonymous. I don&rsquo;t know who submits what. And they&rsquo;re also delayed. I can&rsquo;t see the results of Tevals until after grades are submitted. So please make sure that you take some time to fill out Tevals and give us honest and constructive feedback, any and all feedback you have as welcome on this course. We&rsquo;re constantly trying to update this course and all the other courses in the CC program and your feedback is a real key part of that. So please take some time to make sure you fill out the Tevals for this course. But other than that we&rsquo;re waving the checkered flag. We are almost at the end of the semester. This is the last Announcements video I&rsquo;m going to post I won&rsquo;t do one on finals week, but hopefully everything&rsquo;s going well. Feel free to work on getting this class finished up and I look forward to seeing your final project soon. Good luck.</p>
