<p>Hello, and welcome to the week six Announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2023. This week you should be wrapping up the last modules on debugging and logging and lambda expressions. There&rsquo;s an example project that was due last week. And then right now you should be working on the third restaurant milestone, a lot of which is about adding inheritance and polymorphism into our existing project. You also should be scheduling a meeting with me this week to talk about your final project either this week or next week, just so that we can see that you&rsquo;re on the right track and you&rsquo;re starting to get some ideas for final projects that you might want to work on in this class.</p>
<p>This week, we&rsquo;re starting in one of our new milestones, which is the design patterns. This is content that I previously had later in the class after we introduced user interfaces, but now I&rsquo;ve pulled it forward. So this week, you&rsquo;ll have an example on design patterns and your work on the fourth restaurant milestone, which is about adding several new classes. You&rsquo;ll also have the ability to work on the first concept quiz, which is due at the end of next week. The concept quiz we&rsquo;ll talk about briefly as well.</p>
<p>So for the fourth milestone, we&rsquo;re going to add several new classes to our project that represent different design patterns that we&rsquo;re going to learn about this week, we&rsquo;re going to have the order class, which allows us to keep track of an order of items, the order class is an iterable. The combo class allows us to combine different entrees sides and drinks into a single combo. We&rsquo;ll also have a combo Builder class that uses the builder pattern, and will also have the order number singleton class, which uses the singleton pattern. So these classes allow us to add some really good functionality to our project. And then we&rsquo;ll work on adding unit tests for those classes in the next milestone.</p>
<p>Also available this week is the first concept quiz in this course, you can think of the concept quiz kind of like an exam that you&rsquo;ll do from home. Its take home, it&rsquo;s completely open notes. open book, open code is a quiz on canvas that has a two hour time limit. So once you start working on it, you have to finish it all within that two hour time period and submit it. The quiz will go through some object oriented programming theory, it will cover some code comprehension where you read code and determine what it does, there will be a little bit of UML comprehension reading a UML diagram and understanding what it means you&rsquo;ll write some small unit tests as well. So this quiz, it&rsquo;s not meant to be very difficult, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to study for it very much as long as you understand the concepts we&rsquo;ve introduced so far in the class. And like I said, it&rsquo;s open book open notes open code. So feel free to make sure you have some code in front of you available. But do please be aware of that two hour time limit? It does take away very quickly. Although thus far, I haven&rsquo;t had any students really have trouble not answering all the questions within the time limit. So hopefully it works well for you. If you have any questions or concerns about this, just let me know.</p>
<p>So looking ahead from here, module seven, we&rsquo;ll talk about test doubles, which is the unit tests that we use along with a lot of these design patterns. And then after that, we&rsquo;ll switch over to turning talking about graphical user interfaces and event driven programming. And then eventually we&rsquo;ll shift over and talk about web API&rsquo;s as well. So hopefully things are struggling along for you this semester. We&rsquo;re on Week Six right now, which means we basically have a third of the semester done. Hopefully these new modules work out well. If you have any comments or feedback on them or if something doesn&rsquo;t make sense, let me know. But otherwise, best of luck and I look forward to seeing you again next week.</p>
