<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 10 Announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2023. This week we&rsquo;re going to be working on an external libraries example where we&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about how we can add code from external sources into our program. Then you work on the eighth milestone in the restaurant project where we&rsquo;ll add some new features. And finally, you&rsquo;ll be asked to do a Start Stop continue survey, which is just your chance to give me some quick feedback as we go through the semester. If there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;d like me to change, about how we&rsquo;re approaching the course.</p>
<p>So for the eighth milestone, we&rsquo;re going to be updating our GUI to handle orders and combos, so you&rsquo;ll be updating stuff on the sidebar, so that handles orders properly as you add items to your order. And as you edit them, we&rsquo;re also going to add buttons and a new panel for creating and editing combos. So there should be a button for each individual preset combo, plus a custom combo button that you can use to create a custom combo using any entree site and drink that you&rsquo;d like. The panel for combo should have some basic unit testing, mainly making sure that if you give it a combo, it properly populates it. And also, if you have it properly populated, it saves the correct combo. And then finally, we&rsquo;re going to implement the factory method pattern by abstracting some of our panel code into a panel factory. That will just make it a little bit easier for our button handlers to actually request the correct panel, since we have some duplicated code and a couple of places. Looking ahead for the rest of this class after this milestone, we&rsquo;ll have one more on traditional user interfaces, where we talk about making a release of your project. And also we&rsquo;ll add the checkout functionality to our user interface.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll switch over to module 12. And we&rsquo;ll start working on our Web UI. And we&rsquo;ll have a few smaller modules around web UIs. The web milestones are about half the size of these milestones that you&rsquo;re working on right now. So they should go a little bit faster and give you some more time to work on your final project. So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>Right now. We&rsquo;re working on building a restaurant that serves food and keeps track of orders. So hopefully you can build a tool that Squidward would be able to use to take everybody&rsquo;s order at the Krusty Krab. As always, if you have any questions, let me know otherwise, I will look forward to seeing you again next week.</p>
