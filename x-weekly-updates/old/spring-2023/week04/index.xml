This week, you should have wrapped up the module on documentation unit testing and creating UML diagrams for your project. There’s also an example and then the second restaurant milestone that’s all about adding testing and documentation to your restaurant project. Hopefully, you’ve got all of those turned in by now, and I’ll work on getting them graded later this week.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/x-weekly-updates/old/spring-2023/week04/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
