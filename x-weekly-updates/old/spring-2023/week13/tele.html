<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 13 Announcements video for CC 410 In spring 2023. This week, you should continue working on the milestones around adding a web interface to your project. This week, we&rsquo;re going to deal with rest, which is a really important concept in web interfaces. And you&rsquo;ll also learn how to create some forms and deal with form data. And then that all comes together to the restaurant project where you&rsquo;re going to add a form where you can create a custom item and add it to your restaurants menu. This is a separate area from the rest of the menu. So don&rsquo;t try and put those both in the same place, it really doesn&rsquo;t work will have the normal menu and then we&rsquo;ll have another page that just has the custom menu items as well.</p>
<p>This week, you should also continue working on the final project. Be aware that this is week 13 of 16. So there are just three weeks left in the semester. So hopefully you&rsquo;re getting done with all of the work that you need for the final project. We&rsquo;ll have another final project check in in a week or so. And then your final project presentation will be due on finals week. Typically, we do those on either Monday or Friday for this course. Because Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I&rsquo;m on campus for the computer science in your project.</p>
<p>So for the 11th milestone, like I talked about, we&rsquo;re going to add web forms, we&rsquo;re also going to add the ability to add some search filters and present the results to this as well. So make sure you&rsquo;re keeping up with that. I think I misspoke earlier. I don&rsquo;t think we had to customize them for another milestone. But you&rsquo;re definitely going to play around with some web forms and being able to search and filter your results. So this is a really cool technique for working with websites, building these filters. So hopefully this milestone goes really well. And then, like we said, upcoming, we&rsquo;re going to deal with rest controllers, we&rsquo;re going to deal with serialization of data. And like I said, this is smaller milestones, it&rsquo;s meant to give you more time for the final project. Each of these web milestones should be pretty simple. You&rsquo;re pretty much just following along with the example and building it out a little bit.</p>
<p>But as always, if you have any questions, you can let me know. But we&rsquo;re looking toward the end of the semester. So hopefully you&rsquo;re looking forward to that we&rsquo;re getting very close to the middle of May. Hopefully everything&rsquo;s going well with you this semester. But if you have any questions or concerns or you just need some help with your final project, feel free to contact me anytime and I&rsquo;d be happy to help. Have a good week.</p>
