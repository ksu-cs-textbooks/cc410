<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 14 Announcements video for CC 410 in Spring 2023, as you can see, I&rsquo;ve got the green screen behind me, I&rsquo;m getting ready to record some new videos for some other classes. So this week, you should be working on your fourth Final Project milestone, which is talking about ways you&rsquo;re going to integrate libraries and API&rsquo;s. So make sure you&rsquo;re scheduling that meeting with me over the next week or so. So you can look at your final project and make sure you&rsquo;re on track. Also, this week, you should be working on the second concept quiz in this class, this quiz goes a little bit more in depth into unit testing and some of the other structures that we&rsquo;ve looked at and design patterns. So make sure you schedule a lot of time for that you&rsquo;ve got I believe, two or three hours to work on that. So make sure you look at that and schedule that in your schedule.</p>
<p>The rest of this week, you&rsquo;re going to be working on a rest example learning a little bit more about restful API&rsquo;s and adding that to your restaurant project. And then of course, you should keep working on your final project were on week 14 of 16 in the semester, so you&rsquo;ve only got a couple of weeks left. So this week, you should be working on milestone 12, which is all about building a RESTful web app, you&rsquo;re going to create some menu items that are custom and added to the the system in a different way. And this helps us reinforce some of the design patterns that we&rsquo;ve already seen, such as the iterator pattern and the singleton pattern. But we&rsquo;re going to use that in a different way in a web application, you&rsquo;re also going to spend some time updating the UML diagram, I&rsquo;m mostly concerned with the new stuff. So the web stuff and the custom items, I&rsquo;m not so worried about the rest of the stuff that you&rsquo;ve done previously. So make sure your UML accurately reflects the structure of the web part of your project.</p>
<p>Next week, there&rsquo;ll be another milestone on serialization. You&rsquo;ll have an example on validation and serialization and a restaurant milestone on that that&rsquo;s the last restaurant milestone. And again next week, you should keep working on the final project. And then for the rest of the semester. There is one extra module at the end, which is the textbooks extras module, there&rsquo;s a quiz that&rsquo;s due on finals week. And then your final project presentation is also due by the end of finals week, which is May 12.</p>
<p>So for your final project, you&rsquo;ve got a few deliverables that you&rsquo;ll need to turn in. First and foremost, you&rsquo;ll need to make a release tag on GitHub just for everything else. Make sure you read the requirements page for the final project. So you know you meet all of the requirements for that. Your code should have some documentation and some user documentation such as a readme, so that I know what it does and how to run it. And then you&rsquo;ll need to make a presentation. So the presentation should be about 30 minutes, you can either pre record the presentation or you can schedule time to present it live to me. Either way, you need to schedule a time to meet with me in person so that we can have some q&amp;a before the end of finals week. If you&rsquo;re presenting live, please schedule about 30 to 45 minutes. If you&rsquo;re pre recording schedule at least 15 minutes for q&amp;a. For the presentation. Most of these you&rsquo;ll give either Monday or final Friday of finals week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, a finals week, I&rsquo;m busy with other class presentations. So look at my schedule on Calendly. And go ahead and grab your time on either Monday or Friday. Again, even if you&rsquo;re pre recording your presentation, you still need to schedule a time to meet with me. And it must be after your presentation is submitted. So make sure you get that done. So I have time to review your presentation. And then we&rsquo;ll have some q&amp;a live via zoom. So make sure you&rsquo;re scheduling that ASAP.</p>
<p>For your presentation, here&rsquo;s a quick suggested outline. You can also find this on the final project. Introduction is pretty self explanatory background. Tell me about why you chose this project and where the idea comes from. Talk me through the implementation of your project your code, how you use structures, design patterns, all the things we did in the class evaluation, how well does your project actually meet your original goal? Talk about future work. If you were to continue to work on this project, what would you do? Give me a quick summary and then demo, I want you to be able to demo and walk me through a lot of the major functionality of your project and probably also walked me through the code and kind of explain how you took what we did in the restaurant project and adapted it to your final project.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re nearing the end of the semester. Hopefully you&rsquo;re not too scared about it, but we&rsquo;re getting close to the end. As always, if you have any questions, let me know otherwise, I will see you again next week.</p>
