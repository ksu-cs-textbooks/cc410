<p>Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2021. So this week we&rsquo;re wrapping up the second week working on modules four, and five. So hopefully by now you&rsquo;ve turned in the stuff on inheritance and polymorphism along with the example that gives you a good idea of what you&rsquo;re doing in milestone three. There&rsquo;s also some other things you can do right now, the start-stop-continue survey, which is really good chance to give me feedback, if there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;d like me to start doing in this class or make sure I continue doing or if there&rsquo;s anything that I&rsquo;m doing that you&rsquo;d prefer that I stopped doing. These are all examples of things that you can tell me about. That just helps me build this class in a way that&rsquo;s really useful for students. And I&rsquo;m hoping that you can spend some time this week and next week working on your final project. And then hopefully each of you meet with me sometime this coming week. So that we can talk about your final project and see how things are going so far.</p>
<p>For this week, there are a couple more tutorials on debugging and logging and lambda expressions. These are things that we&rsquo;re not necessarily going to build into our projects at all. But it&rsquo;s really cool stuff that you&rsquo;ll see a little bit and it might be very useful for you. But the big thing we&rsquo;ll be doing this week is spending a lot of time working on your restaurant milestones. So milestone three is due at the end of this week. And again, hopefully, we&rsquo;ll be doing some time working on the final project, thinking about it doing some design work, and then scheduling a meeting to meet with me and discuss the final project.</p>
<p>So quick reminders about milestone three, this is the first one where we are enforcing all of the general requirements. So all the style documentation unit testing requirements. So far, it seems like everybody has been doing a good job taking care of the style requirement in the background anyway. So I don&rsquo;t think that will be too difficult. The biggest thing you&rsquo;ll be doing is adding some inheritance to this project refactoring some of your classes, updating some unit tests and then updating the UML diagram to match. This one is about 1500 lines of code. I think it was about 1000 new and maybe 500 lines of code that I actually removed from my model solution when I did this. And as always, feedback is welcome. So if you have any questions or comments about the milestone, please let me know.</p>
<p>Some quick hints for working with milestone three. work in small chunks, this is probably one of the biggest project milestones were working in small chunks is important. Try and make one little change committed, see if it works, make another little change committed, see if it works. So commit early commit often that way, if you do have any problems, you can roll back in get, and you can get back to a previously working state. This is also a good chance to try test driven development, you can actually go in and write the unit tests first, and see which ones fail and then go through and modify your code until they all pass again. In the instructions, I&rsquo;m not very clear, you can actually inherit the order item interface either on each individual class or I recommend inheriting it on the base classes, the entree drink inside base classes, which will then be carried forward on those classes that are inherited by all of your entrees, drinks and sides. The other big thing is make sure if you have any questions on syntax in here, there are some strange things, especially in Python for how you do abstract classes that are also using properties. So if you have any questions on the particular syntax of that, let me know I do have a working model solution that I can refer to. So I can help you get past those if you run into that.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, like I&rsquo;ve said for a couple weeks now, once we get past this week, the next module will be on GUIs. So we&rsquo;ll be building a graphical user interface for our program. So module six is all about just scaffolding the GUI making it look like you want getting the interaction between the screens. And then module seven, which is the project I&rsquo;ve been working on this week is Event Driven Programming, actually building the button handlers and things for your GUI so that you can create orders and populate a list of items in an order. Then module eight, which is the model solution, part I&rsquo;m going to work on this week is going to be on design patterns and combos, we want to actually be able to create a combo meal in our interface. And it actually turns out that that is an interesting structural change to look at. So that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m going to be working on. And you&rsquo;ll be doing that in module eight, about three or four weeks from now. Module nine, the plan is to work on an external library, I&rsquo;m going to try and get or build a library that references a cash drawer. So we can see what working with external libraries looks like. Those four modules will probably be the next big chunk of the class. And then like this week, we&rsquo;ll have a week after that, where we will take some time working on the final project. And then going forward as we get to Module 10. and beyond. We&rsquo;ll start talking about web API&rsquo;s and some other ways we can expand our project out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all I got for this week. It&rsquo;s a pretty short week because there&rsquo;s not a whole lot that&rsquo;s new going on. Hopefully you all survived the cold weather that was the this past week. I know it was really rough here in Kansas City. Thankfully, we didn&rsquo;t lose power but a lot of my family I have some family down in Texas who did lose power. So I hope you&rsquo;re all doing well. I hope you&rsquo;re all staying safe. staying warm. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me any time either via either via the cc410-help email address or via Discord. I&rsquo;m always here to help. Otherwise Good luck this week and I will see you next week.</p>

<h1 id="update-to-example-5-python">Update to Example 5 Python</h1>

<p>It appears that I missed an interesting error when developing Example 5 for Python. It is a bit complex, so I&rsquo;m relying on the advanced formatting of this webpage to help explain it better than I can via email or in a short post to the class. I&rsquo;ll start with a short version, and then include a longer discussion of the problem and how I came to a solution that I feel is very helpful reading for anyone learning to program and solve these issues in their own work.</p>
<h2 id="tldr---the-short-version">tl;dr - The Short Version</h2>
<p>Currently pytest has a <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" target="_blank">bug</a>
 that causes errors when logging to <code>sys.stderr</code> when running code inside of <code>pytest</code>.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, <code>pytest</code> tries to capture all output being printed to <code>sys.stderr</code> by redirecting it to a buffer (a virtual file) when running the tests. Once it is done, it will close the buffer and redirect output back to <code>sys.stderr</code>. Unfortunately, our logger does not realize this, and it may continue to try and write data to the buffer that is now closed, resulting in the <code>ValueError: I/O operation on closed file</code> error message seen in the output.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session/44595269#44595269" target="_blank">methods</a>
 to determine if code is running under <code>pytest</code> and disable logging in that case.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">this method</a>
:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys

Alternatively, you can disable the handler that prints to <code>sys.stderr</code> and instead just use a file handler.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>
<p>Since this is an advanced programming course, I figure that it is worth a bit of a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into this situation so you can understand what I found, the efforts I went through to solve it, and how things are really working behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This is a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a>
, where I attempt to show you my thought processes and how I go about solving a problem like this. My hope is that you&rsquo;ll be able to learn from this process and possibly use this knowledge to help you solve your own problems in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the world of higher education, we spend way too much time focusing on narrowly-scoped, previously-solved problems, to allow you to learn in an environment where we know a solution is possible in a set amount of time. In the real world, however, you&rsquo;ll be constantly presented with broadly-scoped, open-ended problems like this one, where you&rsquo;ll have to do some exploration to find possible causes and solutions, and then use your own background and knowledge to determine what solutions, if any, are available.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<h3 id="the-error">The Error</h3>
<p>When you run <code>pytest</code> in Example 5 after adding some logging code as directed in the video, you will see many pages of errors printed to the terminal. In my testing, the terminal in Codio printed errors for several minutes before finally stopping. A screenshot of a small portion of those errors is below.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-bcbb0485d70ff6952a2d02c4edbcc5f8" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/410_e5_errors.png" alt="Errors" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/410_e5_errors.png" alt="Errors" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>When this happens, you may be able to use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the output, but in many cases I simply had to close the terminal tab in Codio.</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>When I developed this example, I focused on the debugging portion first, and then later added the logging code. However, I neglected to run <code>pytest</code> after adding the logging code to my model solution, and did not encounter this error in my initial testing. That was an oversight on my part.</p>
<p>As you work on this project, you may end up adding the logging code first while still working on debugging the errors in the project. In that case, you will most likely run <code>tox</code> or <code>pytest</code> to run the unit tests contained in the project with the logging code in place. That will cause the error to appear. As soon as I ran <code>tox</code> in my existing model solution, my code presented this error.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-solved-the-problem">How I solved the problem</h3>
<p>The process of finding a solution for this problem went in three phases.</p>
<h6 id="phase-1---searching">Phase 1 - Searching</h6>
<p>First, I attempted to Google some of the error message and a few things that I suspected were at play. I already had a hunch that the error itself was coming from the logging code, since I had added that to my model solution last. After reproducing the bug in my solution, I set out to solve it. Some Google search phrases I used:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pytest logging stderr write to closed file</code> - Including keywords <code>pytest</code> and <code>logging</code> as well as the <code>stderr</code> stream and a bit of the error message.</li>
<li><code>pytest stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - adding more details such as the line of code causing the error and the exact error messages.</li>
<li><code>&quot;pytest&quot; stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - putting <code>&quot;pytest&quot;</code> in quotes will find results that always include that keyword</li>
</ol>
<p>There were others, but this was the most fruitful.</p>
<h6 id="phase-2---isolate-the-error">Phase 2 - Isolate the Error</h6>
<p>In several of those searches, I came across a few bug reports on GitHub, specifically within the <code>pytest</code> project&rsquo;s repository. Bug reports and discussions on GitHub are usually very fruitful when looking for technical errors that include code and error messages, so I looked into a few of them.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/14" target="_blank">ValueError: I/O Operation on closed file (#14)</a>
 - this was the first one I found. However, I quickly ruled it out, as it was first posted in 2010 and mainly seemed to use Python 2 instead of Python 3. After scrolling through the discussion, nothing really seemed to fit the situation I was in, so I ignored it and moved on. However, it did reference the next issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5743" target="_blank">Improve error message when tests use closed stdout/stderr (capture) (#5743)</a>
 - this one felt like it was a bit closer. In this report, they discuss the fact that pytest will redirect and close system streams such as <code>sys.stderr</code> as part of the test. It was also much more recent, and some of the error messages they were running into were similar to what I was seeing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5282" target="_blank">pytest 4.5 floods the output with logging errors when logging from atexit handlers (#5282)</a>
 - similar to the one above, this one was getting closer to the issue I was seeing, though it wasn&rsquo;t an exact match. By reading these three thread, I was starting to get a feel for the crux of the error - if our logger is trying to write to any of the output streams, like <code>sys.stderr</code> or <code>sys.stdout</code>, then most likely <code>pytest</code> would interfere with that and cause this error. Thankfully, the last two issues both referenced this issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" target="_blank">pytest capture logging error still happening (#5502)</a>
 - this report had a lot of discussion on it, but pretty much sealed the deal for me. One of the core <code>pytest</code> developers posted <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502#issuecomment-526348052" target="_blank">a message</a>
 that included this text:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What I believe is happening is:</p>
<ol>
<li>pytest changes <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to a buffer while importing test modules.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s user code setting up logging and/or creating a <code>logging.StreamHandler</code> at the import level, it will attach itself to pytest&rsquo;s buffer.</li>
<li>When pytest is about to finish the test session, it will restore <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to the original values, and close the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; buffer.</li>
<li>Here the problem happens: if any message is emitted at this point, the <code>StreamHandler</code> will try to attach itself to the buffer, hence the error.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve now found what we suspect is the error. All we have to do is figure out how to resolve it.</p>
<h6 id="phase-3---the-fix">Phase 3 - The Fix</h6>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="%28https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502%29">issue #5502</a>
 is still open as of this writing, so we needed a way to get around this error. With some quick testing, I was able to confirm the error went away if I removed the <code>StreamHandler</code> from the existing logging code. So, I decided that the best way to deal with this was to find some way to disable logging while the code is running as part of a unit test. This is a somewhat common, though discouraged, trick in programming. Ideally you don&rsquo;t want to hide any code from the unit tests, but in some instances you want to make sure that the unit tests don&rsquo;t actually change live data, such as the actual database used by this program. So, you can &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the code that connects to the database and make sure it cannot run as part of a unit test.</p>
<p>A quick Google search for <code>determine if code is running under pytest python</code> quickly lead me to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session" target="_blank">StackOverflow post</a>
 discussing this very issue. Great! I had quickly found a pretty good resource that might lead me to a solution.</p>
<p>Within the discussion, there are a few solutions suggested, and helpfully ranked by the upvotes from other users.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">Solution 1</a>
 - simply check <code>if &quot;pytest&quot; in sys.modules:</code> since the <code>pytest</code> application will always be loaded when running a test. This solution seemed pretty simple and didn&rsquo;t have many obvious side effects, provided your application didn&rsquo;t load <code>pytest</code> as part of its normal execution.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25188424" target="_blank">Solution 2</a>
 - a solution that points to a section of the <a href="http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#detect-if-running-from-within-a-pytest-run" target="_blank">pytest Manual</a>
 that shows the preferred way of doing this. In short, we place some code in the <code>conftest.py</code> file, which is only executed as part of a unit test, to update a value in our code, and then check that value where needed. This looks promising, and is probably the correct answer that would work in all cases, but also requires significantly more code and adds a structural dependency between our code and the <code>conftest.py</code> file.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58866220" target="_blank">Solution 3</a>
 - a third solution suggests checking for the existence of the <code>PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST</code> environment variable, which is set when pytest is running. This may also work, but has the side effect of being outside of our control - any other application on our system could also set that variable, including another instance of <code>pytest</code>, so it may not work as reliably as the other two.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I chose <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">Solution 1</a>
, and updated the code at the top of my <code>main()</code> method in <code>TicTacToe.py</code> to the following:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys

If so, it will disable the logger globally in my program.</p>
<p>An alternative solution would be to just disable the <code>StreamHandler</code> and allow the <code>FileHandler</code> to remain enabled, but I felt that logging from unit tests is not helpful and chose to disable it entirely.</p>

<p>I hope this discussion is helpful - I&rsquo;ve found that sometimes the best opportunities for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a>
 happen directly as a result of the class, so I wanted to take this chance and share a bit of my own problem solving process here.</p>
