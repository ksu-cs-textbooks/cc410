      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to CC 410. My name is Russell Feldhausen. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be your instructor for this semester. And this is the first of the weekly announcements videos that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this class. My goal is throughout the semester, if I have anything interesting to talk about each week, I will try and record a video and post it sometime around Monday morning.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week two announcements video for CC 410 in Spring 2021. So this week, you should be wrapping up module one and hello real world, the first example projects in this class, they were actually both due Sunday night. But if you haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten them completed, you can still turn them in right now, check the late policy in the syllabus for the exact details of the late policy.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Good morning, and welcome to the week three announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2021, this has been a busy second week of the class. But hopefully at this point you should be, you should have already met with me for your final project milestone one where we discuss some ideas for your final project. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve covered almost everybody in this class at this point.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week 4 announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2021. So you should be wrapping up at this point all of the stuff for module three, which is the documentation, testing and UML module. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the larger modules in terms of tutorial content. And also in terms of the actual final project, or the restaurant project content, writing unit tests is a lot of code.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2021. So this week we&amp;rsquo;re wrapping up the second week working on modules four, and five. So hopefully by now you&amp;rsquo;ve turned in the stuff on inheritance and polymorphism along with the example that gives you a good idea of what you&amp;rsquo;re doing in milestone three. There&amp;rsquo;s also some other things you can do right now, the start-stop-continue survey, which is really good chance to give me feedback, if there&amp;rsquo;s anything you&amp;rsquo;d like me to start doing in this class or make sure I continue doing or if there&amp;rsquo;s anything that I&amp;rsquo;m doing that you&amp;rsquo;d prefer that I stopped doing.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the week six enhancements video for CC 410 in Spring 2021. We&amp;rsquo;re over a third of the way through the semester at this point. So hopefully should be wrapping up the stuff from last week, which was on debugging and logging and lambda expressions. There was also a restaurant milestone, this is the last of the data part of the restaurant milestone before we move into the GUI part.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2021, for week seven. So some quick updates for this week I posted last week. But hopefully you all saw this I have moved all the course deadlines from Sundays to Mondays. Part of that is to give you a little bit more time to work on the projects. But also a lot of that is to give you the chance to work on the weekends, and then give me a chance to catch up with questions on Mondays.</description>
