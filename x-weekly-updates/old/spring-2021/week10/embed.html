<p>Hello and welcome to the CC 410 week 10 video for spring 2021. You&rsquo;re working on a double week this week so this week is basically continuing the stuff that you&rsquo;ve been doing for week nine and week 10. So this week you&rsquo;re going to focus on releases where we actually take our software and package it into a release package that you could then share online you could upload to some of the package managers that we&rsquo;ve seen. So you can do lots of cool stuff with that we&rsquo;re not actually going to use it in our project but it&rsquo;s a really cool tool to have in your back pocket.</p>
<p>But the big thing you&rsquo;re working on this week is milestone seven for the restaurant where you&rsquo;re building the checkout system and actually integrating the orders and combos that you built in milestone six. This is one of the larger milestones, but it&rsquo;s one of the last big milestones for this project. Also this week you should be scheduling a final project meeting with me. Hopefully this time you&rsquo;ve got some ideas for your final project you maybe got some code written down and you have an idea of where your path is going forward. We&rsquo;re just about getting into April which means you&rsquo;ve got one month and a little bit more than that to work on your final project over the next few weeks. We&rsquo;ll still have a few more restaurant milestones, I&rsquo;m shooting for probably either 10 or 11 milestones in total so there will be four, three or four more but you&rsquo;ll have more time to work on your final project. These will be slightly smaller milestones than the ones you&rsquo;re used to just to give you a little bit more time to work on your final project.</p>
<p>So we talked about milestone seven last time, so i&rsquo;m not going to talk too much more on that. Big thing is getting the GUI for the combo created and then integrating the checkout portions using the external library that i gave. So hopefully this works really well. It&rsquo;s very much an open ended milestone; there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways you could accomplish this so if you have any questions on style or usage or anything like that feel free to ask me via the cc410-help email address or via Discord and I would be happy to help you out with those.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m working on the next modules right now, probably later today I&rsquo;m going to record the example for the module 11 which is going to be on web interfaces, and so the next milestone in the restaurant project will be building a simple web interface for the menu but it really starts to open your eyes to what you can do with web technologies in this project. But, like I said we&rsquo;re going to have more few more milestones; there&rsquo;ll be smaller than the previous ones for the restaurant project and the hope is to give you more time to work on your final project toward the first of May.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got this week. If you have any questions you can always reach me via the cc410-help email address or on Discord. Otherwise, good luck on your milestones, I look forward to meeting you all this week for your final project and keep up the good work!</p>
