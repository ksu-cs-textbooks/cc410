    <title>Fall &#39;24 Week 2 :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/x-weekly-updates/old/fall-2024/week02/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello and welcome to the week two announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2024. This week you should be wrapping up the first module in the class which includes the Hello Real World example project. All you really have to do for that project is watch the video and follow along and then submit what you have gotten completed at the end of that. You also should have scheduled a meeting to meet with me for the first final project milestone so if you haven’t done that please make sure you do that this week. All we’re really going to do is chat about the final project in this class and give you a chance to ask any questions you might have. You don’t have to come up with a project or anything at this point. I just like to get you thinking about it now so that when we do get to the final project later in October you already have an idea that you’ve been thinking about and you’re ready to go.</description>
