    <description>Resources Slides Edited Transcript Hello, and welcome to the Week 8 announcements video for CC410 in fall 2024. This week you should be wrapping up the module on test doubles. You should have also scheduled a meeting with me for your second final project milestone where we’ll talk a little bit more about final project ideas. And hopefully you should have also completed the first concept quiz, which goes over some of the big concepts in this class. I’m going to work on getting all of that graded this week. It may take me a couple of days to get through everything, but I’ll try and get you feedback as soon as I can.</description>
