<p>Hello and welcome to the week 14 announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2024. So this week you should be scheduling your final project check-in with me. This is the fourth final project milestone and the last one before you turn it in. So this is a last good chance to look at your final project and see how things going. We also have the second concept quiz that&rsquo;s out and due this Friday so make sure that you get that done. As with the previous quiz it takes an hour or so to complete so make sure you schedule enough time for that. You&rsquo;re also going to be working on an example project for restful routing and then the next restaurant milestone after Thanksgiving is also going to be about restful routing and so you should be working on that while you work on your final project as well.</p>
<p>So like I said the next milestone is all about building this restful web application where you can create update and delete new custom menu items. It&rsquo;s going to reinforce some of the design patterns that we&rsquo;ve covered previously in this semester including the iterator pattern and the singleton pattern and it also gives you one last chance to update the UML diagram for your project before the end of the semester. After that after Thanksgiving the next week of class we&rsquo;ll have serialization and validation, we&rsquo;ll have one more restaurant milestone and again you&rsquo;ll get to keep working on the final project before the end of the semester. After that there&rsquo;s one quiz for textbook extras that&rsquo;s just extra things I wanted to cover in this course and then your final project milestone is due by the end of finals week which is December 13th.</p>
<p>So for your final project there are a few deliverables. First you should have a release tag on GitHub with your code just like we&rsquo;ve done for all the milestones. Make sure you read the requirements page for the final project to make sure you have all the things that you&rsquo;re looking for included in your code. Your code should have documentation in line just like we&rsquo;ve done for all the projects. You probably should have some sort of a read me or user documentation that discusses how to run and how to use your project and then of course you will do a presentation for your project as well. The presentation itself should be around 15 to 20 minutes in length. You can choose to either pre-record your presentation using tools like Zoom where you can share your screen and record yourself presenting or you can schedule a time to present it with me live sometime during finals week. If you do pre-record or present live, we&rsquo;ll have some time for Q&amp;A. So if you send in a pre-recorded video, make sure you schedule a short amount of time with me after you&rsquo;ve submitted your videos so that we can do some Q&amp;A. Right now I&rsquo;m planning on being available Mondays, Thursday, and Friday of finals week. So make sure you look at my schedule and get scheduled ASAP.</p>
<p>For your presentation itself, on the Canvas textbook page I give a suggested outline, here&rsquo;s kind of that outline. You should start by introducing your project and giving the background for why you chose this project, why you&rsquo;re interested in this project, things like that. Then you&rsquo;ll spend some time discussing the implementation of your project yourself, including the code and the structures that you used. You&rsquo;ll do a quick evaluation of yourself and see how well you actually met your initial goals. You&rsquo;ll talk about your future work if you want to work on this project again into the future. You&rsquo;ll give a short conclusion and then you&rsquo;ll switch over and give a demo. In the demo, I encourage you not only to show your project working, but also talk your way through your code a little bit. So feel free to share both your screen with your app running and a screen with your code so that you can talk through anything that you think is interesting or useful for your project.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really where we&rsquo;re at. We&rsquo;re on week 14 of 16, so we&rsquo;re getting close to the end of the semester. Hopefully that&rsquo;s not freaking you out too much. If you have any questions or concerns with this class, let me know. Otherwise, I hope you have a great Thanksgiving break and I will see you again in a couple weeks.</p>
