<p>Hello and welcome to the week six announcements video for CC410 in fall 2024. So this week you should be wrapping up the modules on debugging, logging and Lambda expressions. There&rsquo;s a small example that you do on debugging and logging and then the third restaurant milestone is due pretty soon. So make sure you get that done. You also should be scheduling your second final project meeting with me. So I look forward to hearing about some of your interests and things that you&rsquo;re looking at for your final project. This is again, just a quick discussion to see where you&rsquo;re at on project planning and maybe give you some advice of things that you could start working on in your final project as you have some time over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>So this week we&rsquo;re going to launch into one of the most important topics in this class, which is design patterns. So you&rsquo;ll do a small example this week, building some design patterns in an example project and then you&rsquo;ll update your restaurant project to include some new design patterns and you&rsquo;ll also work on the first concept quiz. So for the fourth milestone, we&rsquo;re going to add some new design patterns building around an order class, a combo class, a combo builder class and an order number singleton class. All of those are pretty important classes for us to be able to build orders and combos out of our menu items that we can add to our cart. So you&rsquo;re going to keep track of all of those. We&rsquo;re just building those in this milestone. And then the unit tests for a lot of these are going to be in the next milestone. I used to do these all in one milestone, but I found it was a lot easier to split them into two milestones. So you have time to work on building the code for all the different design patterns in this class. And the next time we&rsquo;ll add the unit tests as we learn about test doubles and mocking.</p>
<p>So the other thing that you&rsquo;ll have this week is the first concept quiz. This is basically a quiz to check your understandings of some of the concepts that we&rsquo;ve covered in this class, including object oriented programming theory, code comprehension, UML comprehension and the ability to do unit testing. I want you to think of these not exactly as an exam, but more of a check for understanding for a lot of the concepts that we worked on. This has a two hour time limit and it is open book, open notes, open code, but all of the- Your work should be your own. So for example, do not go to chat GPT and ask it these questions and then copy paste the answers. You can reference your book, you can reference your notes, you can reference your code from this class, but I really want this to be a representation of your own work and understanding of these topics. That&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m looking for just to see how well you actually have understood some of the bigger concepts that we&rsquo;re looking at in this class. So that&rsquo;s what this quiz is about.</p>
<p>Looking ahead after this, the next module we&rsquo;ll talk about test doubles, which is really what we need to do unit testing for a lot of these design patterns. Then we&rsquo;ll shift gears, we&rsquo;ll start talking about graphical user interfaces and how we can do things with event -driven programming to make our GUIs more effective. So hopefully everything&rsquo;s going well. Hopefully things are progressing very nicely in this class. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise I look forward to seeing you all again next week.</p>
