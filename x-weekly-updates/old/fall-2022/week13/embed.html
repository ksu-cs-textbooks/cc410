<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 13 Announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2022 This week you should be working on the second of the web milestones. This one you&rsquo;re going to learn about restful API&rsquo;s and also about Web Forms. You&rsquo;ll do an example around using form data to search through the movies collection. And then the milestone will be to create a search form for the items in the menu. As you&rsquo;re working on this project this week, make sure you should be continuing to work on your final project. If you haven&rsquo;t had the third project meeting with me yet, you should have done that you should also be close to doing the fourth project meeting with me, just so I can see your progress on the funnel project. At this point, hopefully you should have some code done. But if you have any questions, or you&rsquo;re still not sure where you&rsquo;re going on the final project, just let me know.</p>
<p>So like I said, the ninth milestone is all about creating web forms, you&rsquo;re going to create a form for an advanced search through the menu of items on a restaurant. Then you&rsquo;ll create some search filters on the menu to actually filter by keywords by price by calories, things like that. And then you&rsquo;ll have to present the results on a page. Hopefully, you can reuse some of the code from your previous milestone to help present the results in a nice and orderly fashion on the page. So looking ahead, after this milestone, we&rsquo;re going to spend another milestone on restful controllers to actually create custom items. And then we&rsquo;ll have a last little module on serialization and some other concepts that don&rsquo;t fit anywhere else in the class. As I&rsquo;ve been talking, don&rsquo;t forget these web milestones are meant to be smaller milestones, they should be a lot easier to complete. That should give you more time to work on the final project. And then don&rsquo;t forget that the last milestone for the restaurant project is due on finals week.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at week 13. There&rsquo;s really only two more weeks of the semester left after this one and then we&rsquo;ll have finals week, and then we&rsquo;ll be out of here. So hopefully this milestone this week is very useful to help you find exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for even out there in that huge menu that we&rsquo;ve gotten in the restaurant project. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to let me know and I look forward to seeing you again in a couple weeks. And I hope you all enjoy your Thanksgiving break.</p>
