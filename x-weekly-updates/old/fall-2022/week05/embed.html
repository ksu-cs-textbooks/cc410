<p>Hello, and welcome to the week five Announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2022. This week you should be wrapping up the module on inheritance and polymorphism. There&rsquo;s also an example that goes along with that. But there&rsquo;s not a milestone due this week. You also should have gotten the start stop continue survey, I&rsquo;ve received several responses already. And I&rsquo;ve responded to some of those in an announcement on Canvas. So make sure you check that out. And also, this is a good time to start thinking about your final project and bounce around some ideas of things that you might want to work on as we get toward the end of the semester.</p>
<p>So this week, you&rsquo;re going to have another module that talks about debugging and logging. We&rsquo;re also going to spend a little bit of time on lambda expressions. You&rsquo;ll do an example around debugging and logging and learn how some of those techniques can work. And then you&rsquo;ll be working on the third restaurant milestone, which is mostly about refactoring your code follow object oriented polymorphism. And then we&rsquo;ll also have the the second final project meeting either late this week, or probably next week as well.</p>
<p>So like I said, last week, milestone three is the first milestone for the restaurant where you&rsquo;re going to need to do all general requirements. So you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your code has correct type checking. If you&rsquo;re in Python, it should pass the style checker, it should have documentation, comments and all the source code, it should have unit tests that achieve a high level of code coverage, all of those things is what we&rsquo;re looking for in milestone three. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to update your UML diagram, this one&rsquo;s going to have a lot of associations in it because we now have an object oriented inherited structure. The code, the milestone itself was only about about 1500 lines of new and changed code. So it&rsquo;s a little bit smaller than the last two, but it is quite a bit more complex. And as always, feedback is welcome. If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not quite as clear as it should be in the problem statement itself.</p>
<p>So also, like I said, for milestone three, try and work in small chunks, don&rsquo;t do it all at the same time. an iterative incremental design pattern is really what you want to take in this class. Try and commit early and commit often to git so that if something breaks, you can roll back and try again. You can also give test driven development and try see if you can try and write the tests that you want to pass before you actually write the code itself. There&rsquo;s an Order Item class that you&rsquo;re going to build, I highly recommend that you inherit that on your base class. So the base wrap, drink inside class and not the individual items themselves. And of course, this one has some complex syntax, especially in Python, where you may not have seen some of these things before. So feel free to ask questions, if any of the syntax is confusing, and I&rsquo;d be happy to help you out there.</p>
<p>Looking ahead from this milestone, once we get done with this one, we&rsquo;ll switch over to talk about graphical user interfaces. So we&rsquo;ll go through some basics of that. We&rsquo;ll talk about event driven programming, which is a big concept when working with graphical interfaces, then we&rsquo;ll spend some time talking about design patterns. Design Patterns is probably one of the biggest takeaways in this class. I think it&rsquo;s a super important idea in programming. So we&rsquo;ll spend quite a lot of time on it. And then we&rsquo;ll actually switch over and talk about external libraries, web API&rsquo;s and other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hot this week. This is kind of one of those last little bits of summer before we get really in the fall. So hopefully you&rsquo;re staying cool out there. Make sure you stay hydrated. Make sure you put sunscreen on if you need to. But hopefully we can get past this heatwave and get back to normal pretty soon. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and I will look forward to seeing you again next week.</p>
