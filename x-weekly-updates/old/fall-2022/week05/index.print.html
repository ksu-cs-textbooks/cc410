<p>Hello, and welcome to the week five Announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2022. This week you should be wrapping up the module on inheritance and polymorphism. There&rsquo;s also an example that goes along with that. But there&rsquo;s not a milestone due this week. You also should have gotten the start stop continue survey, I&rsquo;ve received several responses already. And I&rsquo;ve responded to some of those in an announcement on Canvas. So make sure you check that out. And also, this is a good time to start thinking about your final project and bounce around some ideas of things that you might want to work on as we get toward the end of the semester.</p>
<p>So this week, you&rsquo;re going to have another module that talks about debugging and logging. We&rsquo;re also going to spend a little bit of time on lambda expressions. You&rsquo;ll do an example around debugging and logging and learn how some of those techniques can work. And then you&rsquo;ll be working on the third restaurant milestone, which is mostly about refactoring your code follow object oriented polymorphism. And then we&rsquo;ll also have the the second final project meeting either late this week, or probably next week as well.</p>
<p>So like I said, last week, milestone three is the first milestone for the restaurant where you&rsquo;re going to need to do all general requirements. So you&rsquo;ll need to make sure your code has correct type checking. If you&rsquo;re in Python, it should pass the style checker, it should have documentation, comments and all the source code, it should have unit tests that achieve a high level of code coverage, all of those things is what we&rsquo;re looking for in milestone three. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to update your UML diagram, this one&rsquo;s going to have a lot of associations in it because we now have an object oriented inherited structure. The code, the milestone itself was only about about 1500 lines of new and changed code. So it&rsquo;s a little bit smaller than the last two, but it is quite a bit more complex. And as always, feedback is welcome. If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not quite as clear as it should be in the problem statement itself.</p>
<p>So also, like I said, for milestone three, try and work in small chunks, don&rsquo;t do it all at the same time. an iterative incremental design pattern is really what you want to take in this class. Try and commit early and commit often to git so that if something breaks, you can roll back and try again. You can also give test driven development and try see if you can try and write the tests that you want to pass before you actually write the code itself. There&rsquo;s an Order Item class that you&rsquo;re going to build, I highly recommend that you inherit that on your base class. So the base wrap, drink inside class and not the individual items themselves. And of course, this one has some complex syntax, especially in Python, where you may not have seen some of these things before. So feel free to ask questions, if any of the syntax is confusing, and I&rsquo;d be happy to help you out there.</p>
<p>Looking ahead from this milestone, once we get done with this one, we&rsquo;ll switch over to talk about graphical user interfaces. So we&rsquo;ll go through some basics of that. We&rsquo;ll talk about event driven programming, which is a big concept when working with graphical interfaces, then we&rsquo;ll spend some time talking about design patterns. Design Patterns is probably one of the biggest takeaways in this class. I think it&rsquo;s a super important idea in programming. So we&rsquo;ll spend quite a lot of time on it. And then we&rsquo;ll actually switch over and talk about external libraries, web API&rsquo;s and other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hot this week. This is kind of one of those last little bits of summer before we get really in the fall. So hopefully you&rsquo;re staying cool out there. Make sure you stay hydrated. Make sure you put sunscreen on if you need to. But hopefully we can get past this heatwave and get back to normal pretty soon. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and I will look forward to seeing you again next week.</p>

<h1 id="update-to-example-5-python">Update to Example 5 Python</h1>

<p>It appears that I missed an interesting error when developing Example 5 for Python. It is a bit complex, so I&rsquo;m relying on the advanced formatting of this webpage to help explain it better than I can via email or in a short post to the class. I&rsquo;ll start with a short version, and then include a longer discussion of the problem and how I came to a solution that I feel is very helpful reading for anyone learning to program and solve these issues in their own work.</p>
<h2 id="tldr---the-short-version">tl;dr - The Short Version</h2>
<p>Currently pytest has a <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" target="_blank">bug</a>
 that causes errors when logging to <code>sys.stderr</code> when running code inside of <code>pytest</code>.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, <code>pytest</code> tries to capture all output being printed to <code>sys.stderr</code> by redirecting it to a buffer (a virtual file) when running the tests. Once it is done, it will close the buffer and redirect output back to <code>sys.stderr</code>. Unfortunately, our logger does not realize this, and it may continue to try and write data to the buffer that is now closed, resulting in the <code>ValueError: I/O operation on closed file</code> error message seen in the output.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session/44595269#44595269" target="_blank">methods</a>
 to determine if code is running under <code>pytest</code> and disable logging in that case.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">this method</a>
:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys

Alternatively, you can disable the handler that prints to <code>sys.stderr</code> and instead just use a file handler.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>
<p>Since this is an advanced programming course, I figure that it is worth a bit of a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into this situation so you can understand what I found, the efforts I went through to solve it, and how things are really working behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This is a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a>
, where I attempt to show you my thought processes and how I go about solving a problem like this. My hope is that you&rsquo;ll be able to learn from this process and possibly use this knowledge to help you solve your own problems in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the world of higher education, we spend way too much time focusing on narrowly-scoped, previously-solved problems, to allow you to learn in an environment where we know a solution is possible in a set amount of time. In the real world, however, you&rsquo;ll be constantly presented with broadly-scoped, open-ended problems like this one, where you&rsquo;ll have to do some exploration to find possible causes and solutions, and then use your own background and knowledge to determine what solutions, if any, are available.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<h3 id="the-error">The Error</h3>
<p>When you run <code>pytest</code> in Example 5 after adding some logging code as directed in the video, you will see many pages of errors printed to the terminal. In my testing, the terminal in Codio printed errors for several minutes before finally stopping. A screenshot of a small portion of those errors is below.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-5e6be37049a6ba3009607c4018c35e9c" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/e5/410_e5_errors.png" alt="Errors" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox" id="image-5e6be37049a6ba3009607c4018c35e9c">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/e5/410_e5_errors.png" alt="Errors" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>When this happens, you may be able to use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the output, but in many cases I simply had to close the terminal tab in Codio.</p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>When I developed this example, I focused on the debugging portion first, and then later added the logging code. However, I neglected to run <code>pytest</code> after adding the logging code to my model solution, and did not encounter this error in my initial testing. That was an oversight on my part.</p>
<p>As you work on this project, you may end up adding the logging code first while still working on debugging the errors in the project. In that case, you will most likely run <code>tox</code> or <code>pytest</code> to run the unit tests contained in the project with the logging code in place. That will cause the error to appear. As soon as I ran <code>tox</code> in my existing model solution, my code presented this error.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-solved-the-problem">How I solved the problem</h3>
<p>The process of finding a solution for this problem went in three phases.</p>
<h6 id="phase-1---searching">Phase 1 - Searching</h6>
<p>First, I attempted to Google some of the error message and a few things that I suspected were at play. I already had a hunch that the error itself was coming from the logging code, since I had added that to my model solution last. After reproducing the bug in my solution, I set out to solve it. Some Google search phrases I used:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pytest logging stderr write to closed file</code> - Including keywords <code>pytest</code> and <code>logging</code> as well as the <code>stderr</code> stream and a bit of the error message.</li>
<li><code>pytest stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - adding more details such as the line of code causing the error and the exact error messages.</li>
<li><code>&quot;pytest&quot; stream.write(msg) I/O operation on closed file</code> - putting <code>&quot;pytest&quot;</code> in quotes will find results that always include that keyword</li>
</ol>
<p>There were others, but this was the most fruitful.</p>
<h6 id="phase-2---isolate-the-error">Phase 2 - Isolate the Error</h6>
<p>In several of those searches, I came across a few bug reports on GitHub, specifically within the <code>pytest</code> project&rsquo;s repository. Bug reports and discussions on GitHub are usually very fruitful when looking for technical errors that include code and error messages, so I looked into a few of them.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/14" target="_blank">ValueError: I/O Operation on closed file (#14)</a>
 - this was the first one I found. However, I quickly ruled it out, as it was first posted in 2010 and mainly seemed to use Python 2 instead of Python 3. After scrolling through the discussion, nothing really seemed to fit the situation I was in, so I ignored it and moved on. However, it did reference the next issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5743" target="_blank">Improve error message when tests use closed stdout/stderr (capture) (#5743)</a>
 - this one felt like it was a bit closer. In this report, they discuss the fact that pytest will redirect and close system streams such as <code>sys.stderr</code> as part of the test. It was also much more recent, and some of the error messages they were running into were similar to what I was seeing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5282" target="_blank">pytest 4.5 floods the output with logging errors when logging from atexit handlers (#5282)</a>
 - similar to the one above, this one was getting closer to the issue I was seeing, though it wasn&rsquo;t an exact match. By reading these three thread, I was starting to get a feel for the crux of the error - if our logger is trying to write to any of the output streams, like <code>sys.stderr</code> or <code>sys.stdout</code>, then most likely <code>pytest</code> would interfere with that and cause this error. Thankfully, the last two issues both referenced this issue&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502" target="_blank">pytest capture logging error still happening (#5502)</a>
 - this report had a lot of discussion on it, but pretty much sealed the deal for me. One of the core <code>pytest</code> developers posted <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502#issuecomment-526348052" target="_blank">a message</a>
 that included this text:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What I believe is happening is:</p>
<ol>
<li>pytest changes <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to a buffer while importing test modules.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s user code setting up logging and/or creating a <code>logging.StreamHandler</code> at the import level, it will attach itself to pytest&rsquo;s buffer.</li>
<li>When pytest is about to finish the test session, it will restore <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> to the original values, and close the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; buffer.</li>
<li>Here the problem happens: if any message is emitted at this point, the <code>StreamHandler</code> will try to attach itself to the buffer, hence the error.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve now found what we suspect is the error. All we have to do is figure out how to resolve it.</p>
<h6 id="phase-3---the-fix">Phase 3 - The Fix</h6>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="%28https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5502%29">issue #5502</a>
 is still open as of this writing, so we needed a way to get around this error. With some quick testing, I was able to confirm the error went away if I removed the <code>StreamHandler</code> from the existing logging code. So, I decided that the best way to deal with this was to find some way to disable logging while the code is running as part of a unit test. This is a somewhat common, though discouraged, trick in programming. Ideally you don&rsquo;t want to hide any code from the unit tests, but in some instances you want to make sure that the unit tests don&rsquo;t actually change live data, such as the actual database used by this program. So, you can &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the code that connects to the database and make sure it cannot run as part of a unit test.</p>
<p>A quick Google search for <code>determine if code is running under pytest python</code> quickly lead me to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25188119/test-if-code-is-executed-from-within-a-py-test-session" target="_blank">StackOverflow post</a>
 discussing this very issue. Great! I had quickly found a pretty good resource that might lead me to a solution.</p>
<p>Within the discussion, there are a few solutions suggested, and helpfully ranked by the upvotes from other users.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">Solution 1</a>
 - simply check <code>if &quot;pytest&quot; in sys.modules:</code> since the <code>pytest</code> application will always be loaded when running a test. This solution seemed pretty simple and didn&rsquo;t have many obvious side effects, provided your application didn&rsquo;t load <code>pytest</code> as part of its normal execution.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25188424" target="_blank">Solution 2</a>
 - a solution that points to a section of the <a href="http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#detect-if-running-from-within-a-pytest-run" target="_blank">pytest Manual</a>
 that shows the preferred way of doing this. In short, we place some code in the <code>conftest.py</code> file, which is only executed as part of a unit test, to update a value in our code, and then check that value where needed. This looks promising, and is probably the correct answer that would work in all cases, but also requires significantly more code and adds a structural dependency between our code and the <code>conftest.py</code> file.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58866220" target="_blank">Solution 3</a>
 - a third solution suggests checking for the existence of the <code>PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST</code> environment variable, which is set when pytest is running. This may also work, but has the side effect of being outside of our control - any other application on our system could also set that variable, including another instance of <code>pytest</code>, so it may not work as reliably as the other two.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I chose <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44595269" target="_blank">Solution 1</a>
, and updated the code at the top of my <code>main()</code> method in <code>TicTacToe.py</code> to the following:</p>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># get the root logger</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>logger <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> logging<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>getLogger()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># disable if pytest is running</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pytest&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> sys<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>modules:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    logger<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>disabled <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That code will simply load the logger, and immediately check if the <code>&quot;pytest&quot;</code> module is loaded. If so, it will disable the logger globally in my program.</p>
<p>An alternative solution would be to just disable the <code>StreamHandler</code> and allow the <code>FileHandler</code> to remain enabled, but I felt that logging from unit tests is not helpful and chose to disable it entirely.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I hope this discussion is helpful - I&rsquo;ve found that sometimes the best opportunities for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" target="_blank">cognitive apprenticeship</a>
 happen directly as a result of the class, so I wanted to take this chance and share a bit of my own problem solving process here.</p>
