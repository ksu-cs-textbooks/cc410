<p>Hello, and welcome to the Week 12 Announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. As promised, this week we&rsquo;re going to shift gears from building a traditional desktop user interface to start building a web user interface. So this week we&rsquo;re going to start talking about data-driven websites. You&rsquo;ll go through a quick example to install a website framework on top of your existing project, and you&rsquo;ll do that in your restaurant project as well. This is a good time to start working on your final project or keep working on your final project. Most of the milestones from here on out are much, much smaller, so you&rsquo;ve got about four good weeks to really start working on your final project in this class. Remember the final project is meant to be about a third to a fourth of the size of the restaurant project, so a couple thousand lines of code is what we&rsquo;re shooting for. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really looking at to get you to work on for this final project. So hopefully you can get rolling on that this week. If you have any questions, let me know, and I&rsquo;m definitely happy to help with that.</p>
<p>So for the milestone, you&rsquo;re basically going to set up a web framework inside your project. You&rsquo;ll set up things like the web routes, the controller. We&rsquo;ll also talk about using some template inheritance, and so you&rsquo;ll have a master layout template for your whole page. You&rsquo;ll do different templates inside of that for your routes, and eventually at the end of this, you&rsquo;ll have a data-driven menu that basically generates a website that has the menu for your restaurant based on the data classes that we have. Obviously, in practice, you would do this based off of a database instead of a list of classes. We haven&rsquo;t covered databases yet, so we&rsquo;re using our object-oriented classes as a stand-in for a database, but really the theory is the same when you get right down to it.</p>
<p>So after this, we&rsquo;re going to look at how we can actually add forms and custom fields to our website so that we can add custom menu items to our menu. Like I said, smaller milestones from here on out, and it gives you more time to work on the final project. Lastly, there will be one last restaurant milestone that is due on finals week, so make sure you&rsquo;re planning ahead for that. That&rsquo;s a really good thing to have in mind. So quick, we&rsquo;re headed to the World Wide Web. Hopefully, things are going well. If you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, best of luck on this week, and I will see you again next week.</p>
