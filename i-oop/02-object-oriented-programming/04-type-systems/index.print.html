<p>Before we go further into some object-oriented concepts, let&rsquo;s briefly review one important concept in programming - data types and type systems.</p>
<h2 id="primitive-data-types">Primitive Data Types</h2>
<p>Most programming languages include several <strong>primitive data types</strong>, which are the fundamental units of data that can be stored and represented by that programming language. Here&rsquo;s a short list of those primitive data types for each language:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Data</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Java</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Python</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Whole Numbers</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>int</code> (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>)</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>int</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Floating-point Numbers</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>double</code> (<code>float</code>)</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>float</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Boolean Values</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>boolean</code></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>bool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Single Character</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>char</code></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>str</code>^[A string of length 1]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">String of Characters</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>String</code>^[This is not a primitive, but the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">String</a>
 class. However, it is so ubiquitous that we&rsquo;ll include it here.]</td>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>str</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Any data that is stored by our program must fit into one of these data types. That is an important fundamental rule to remember - no matter how complex our code gets, <strong>everything</strong> is stored in primitive data types. That&rsquo;s simply all there is.</p>
<h2 id="complex-data">Complex Data</h2>
<p>What if we want to store more complex data, such as information about a person? Well, we could easily create an integer that stores the person&rsquo;s age, and perhaps a string for the person&rsquo;s name. Those are still just primitive data types, so we&rsquo;re good there.</p>
<p>However, as you probably already know, we can group those items together into <strong>classes</strong>. However, before we can really understand classes and how they relate to encapsulation, we must look at a precursor to classes first. We&rsquo;ll cover that later in this module.</p>
<h2 id="type-systems">Type Systems</h2>
<p>The way that programming languages handle these data types is known as the <strong>type system</strong> of the language. Let&rsquo;s look at two different ways to categorize type systems to see how they differ.</p>
<h3 id="static-typing-vs-dynamic-typing">Static Typing vs. Dynamic Typing</h3>
<p>In programming, there are two common ways that programming languages deal with data types. The first is called <strong>static typing</strong>, where each variable has a particular data type associated with it as soon as it is declared, and that variable can <em>only</em> store items of that data type. Because of this, we can use tools like the Java compiler to analyze our code before we ever execute it, making sure that we always are storing the correct type of data in each variable.</p>
<p>Java is a <strong>statically typed</strong> language. When we create variables in Java, we must assign data types to them, as in this example:</p>
<h6 id="java">Java</h6>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">double</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> 5<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">5</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>String name <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;CC 410&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly, when we create methods in Java, we must declare the types of all parameters, as well as the return type of the method.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, is a <strong>dynamically typed</strong> language. That means that variables in Python do not have a particular data type assigned to them, and they can store multiple different types of data throughout the course of the program. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<h6 id="python">Python</h6>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;CC 410&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a perfectly valid program in Python, and will execute just fine. However, as we&rsquo;ll soon learn, this could lead to some preventable errors, and we&rsquo;ll see how to resolve them.</p>
<h3 id="strong-typing-vs-weak-typing">Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing</h3>
<p>Programming languages can also be classified based on their use of type systems in one other way. A <strong>strongly typed</strong> language always knows what data type is stored in a variable at any given time during the program&rsquo;s execution. In statically typed languages such as Java, this is trivial - if the program compiles, then we know that the <em>only</em> possible data type that could be stored in a variable is the type listed in that variable&rsquo;s declaration. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>However, what about Python? Python is dynamically typed, which means that each variable could store multiple different data types during a single program&rsquo;s execution, and each time the program executes it could be different. However, at any given instant during the execution of the program, the Python interpreter knows exactly what type of data is being stored in each of the variables in the program. We can use methods such as <code>isinstance()</code> to confirm this. So, Python is also a <strong>strongly typed</strong> language.</p>
<p>So, what is a <strong>weakly typed</strong> language? A great example is code written in an assembly language. The computer will simply execute whatever is written, and has no way of keeping track of the types of data stored in each variable. Instead, it depends on the compiler or developer to make sure there are no type errors in the assembly code.</p>
<h3 id="making-python-statically-typed">Making Python Statically Typed</h3>
<p>As we learned in the &ldquo;Hello Real World&rdquo; project, we can add <strong>type annotations</strong> to Python code to convert Python into a statically typed language. Then, we can use tools such as Mypy to make sure there are no type errors in our code, much like the Java compiler does for Java code. So, here&rsquo;s a rewritten example of Python code that is statically typed:</p>
<h6 id="python-1">Python</h6>
<div class="wrap-code highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x: int <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y: float <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>name: str <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;CC 410&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>By adding these type annotations, we can tell Mypy what type of data we expect to be stored in each of these variables, and it can perform the same type checking process that the Java compiler uses. In this class, we&rsquo;re going to focus on using statically typed Python code as much as we can.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re spending a little time reviewing types and type systems now because it will help us understand the new concepts being introduced in the next few pages. Before the introduction of object-oriented programming, programmers had to use other tools to build more complex data types than the primitives we&rsquo;ve discussed here.</p>

<p>Before we dive deeper into object-oriented programming, let&rsquo;s go through a brief refresher about data types and type systems. You most likely learned about this in your first programming course, but at that time it probably didn&rsquo;t make much sense since you were new to everything. However, now that you have some programming experience, you&rsquo;ll be able to better understand these concepts and reframe your knowledge a bit. First, recall that each programming language supports several data types known as &ldquo;primitives.&rdquo; These are built into the language itself, and represent the simplest forms of data the language knows how to properly represent. Shown here are the most commonly used primitive data type for Java and Python. For whole numbers, they both use an integer data type. For floating-point values, Java uses a type called double while Python uses a similar type called float. Both languages also support a data type for a simple Boolean value as well. Finally, both languages can store single characters and whole strings of characters, but these come with a few caveats. In Java, the character type is a primitive, but the String type is technically a class that stores multiple characters together. However, since Strings are so widely used in Java, they can be thought of as a primitive in some ways. Conversely, Python treats the string type as a built-in primitive, but doesn&rsquo;t support a special type for a single character. Instead, a string with length 1 is a stand-in for the character type supported by most other languages.</p>
<p>The reason that we start here is that we must keep in mind that <strong>everything</strong> else that is stored by a program written in either of these languages is made up of just these primitive types. That&rsquo;s all there is. So, when we create a new class, or a struct, we are simply grouping together a bunch of variables of these types and giving the resulting compound type a new name.</p>
<p>So, in short, remember that everything is a primitive data type.</p>
<p>And a class is just a new type definition that consists of other primitive data types grouped together, sometimes with multiple layers of classes underneath.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s briefly discuss <strong>type systems</strong>. A type system refers to how a particular programming language handles assigning and keeping track of data types associated with individual variables. There are two major ways that type systems can be categorized. The first distinction is between <strong>static</strong> and <strong>dynamic</strong> type systems. In a static type system, the data type is associated with a variable when the variable is first created, and once created a variable can only store data of that type - it cannot change. Java is a classic example of a statically typed programming language. Each variable declaration includes a data type, and the Java compiler makes sure that only that type of data can be stored in that variable. If we try to violate that rule, usually the compiler will give us an error before we ever attempt to run the program. On the other hand, a dynamic type system instead looks at the data currently stored by the variable to determine that variable&rsquo;s associated type, and a variable&rsquo;s type may change throughout the program&rsquo;s execution based on the data it currently contains. Python is a great example of a dynamically typed programming language. In Python, we can create a variable named <code>x</code> and store an integer in it, then overwrite that with a floating point number, then a string, and even another object. Each time, the type associated with that variable changes, but Python can always determine what data type is currently stored by variable <code>x</code>. This distinction is very important.</p>
<p>The other way distinction is between <strong>strongly typed</strong> languages and <strong>weakly typed</strong> languages. In a strongly typed language, the computer can always determine the exact type of data being stored by a variable at any given time during the program&rsquo;s execution. For a statically typed language such as Java, this is trivial - we can just look up the type that was declared along with the variable, and we&rsquo;ll know that any program that properly compiles will only allow that type to be stored in that variable. Python, on the other hand, can examine the type of the data stored in the variable to determine it&rsquo;s current type. It does this behind the scenes, but the Python interpreter is always able to tell us what type of data is in a variable. We can use the <code>isinstance()</code> method to examine this information at any time. The other type of language is a weakly typed language. In that case, the computer doesn&rsquo;t know what type of data is stored in a variable, and must trust the developer to handle it properly. Code written directly in assembly is a good example of a weakly typed language. There is no compiler or interpreter to help us enforce strong typing, so as far as the computer knows everything is just a binary blob of data, and it is up to the developer to keep track of each variable&rsquo;s type and how it should be handled. As you can imagine, it is very easy to make grave mistakes when dealing with a weakly typed language!</p>
<p>So, in summary, we can say that Java is both statically typed and strongly typed - each variable has only one associated type, and it can easily keep track of that. Python, while also being strongly typed, is dynamically typed, meaning that the interpreter can figure out what data type is stored in a variable at any given time, but that variable might store multiple different types throughout the program&rsquo;s execution, just not at the same time.</p>
<p>However, in this course, we&rsquo;re going to use <strong>type annotations</strong> in Python to restrict the types that a particular variable can store, and use the Mypy tool to perform some type checking for us, causing Python to work like a statically typed language. This will help us avoid some of the most common errors made by Python developers - improper handling of data types. In that way, we can treat programs written in both Java and Python similarly.</p>
