A struct is an example of a compound data type, a data type composed from other types. This allows us to represent data in more complex ways by combining multiple primitive data types into a new type. This too, is a form of encapsulation, as it allows us to collect several values into a single data structure.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/i-oop/02-object-oriented-programming/05-structs/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
