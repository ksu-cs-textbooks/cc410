    <title>Summary :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/i-oop/02-object-oriented-programming/12-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter, we looked at how object-orientation adopted the concept of encapsulation to combine related state and behavior within a single unit of code, known as a class. We further explored how objects are instances of a class created through invoking a constructor method.&#xA;We also discussed several different ways of looking at and reasoning about objects - as a state machine, and as structured data stored in memory. We discussed how a method is really a form of message passing that provides an interface to interact with objects safely.</description>
