<p>In this chapter, we looked at how object-orientation adopted the concept of <strong>encapsulation</strong> to combine related <strong>state and behavior</strong> within a single unit of code, known as a <strong>class</strong>.  We further explored how <strong>objects are instances of a class</strong> created through invoking a <strong>constructor</strong> method.</p>
<p>We also discussed several different ways of looking at and reasoning about objects - as a <strong>state machine</strong>, and as <strong>structured data stored in memory</strong>.  We discussed how a <strong>method is really a form of message passing</strong> that provides an <strong>interface</strong> to interact with objects safely.</p>
<p>Finally, we explored how all of these concepts are implemented in both the Java and Python programming languages.</p>
