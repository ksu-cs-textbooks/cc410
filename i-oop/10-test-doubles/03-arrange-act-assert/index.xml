    <title>Arrange, Act, Assert :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/i-oop/10-test-doubles/03-arrange-act-assert/index.html</link>
    <description>Most of our unit tests have been following a particular pattern, commonly called arrange, act, assert. Letâ€™s quickly review that pattern, as it is very important to understand how it integrates with the use of test doubles later in this chapter.&#xA;A simple unit test following the arrange, act, assert pattern consists of three major steps:&#xA;Arrange - first, the objects to be tested and any supporting data is created within the test. Act - secondly, the operation being tested is carried out, usually by calling one or more methods. Assert - once the operation is complete, we use assertions to verify that the outcome of the operation is correct. In some instances, we may also include a fourth step, Teardown, which is used to reset the state back to its initial state, if needed. There are times when our arrange step makes some changes to the environment that must be reversed before we can continue.</description>
