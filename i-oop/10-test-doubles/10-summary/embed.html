<p>In this chapter, we learned about <strong>test doubles</strong> and how they can use them in our unit tests to mimic functionality from other parts of our program. In short, there are three different common types of test doubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>stubs - methods that mimic actual methods</li>
<li>fakes - objects that mimic actual objects</li>
<li>mocks - objects that record operations performed on it</li>
</ul>
<p>We also explored how we can use these in our code both Java and Python. Finally, we learned about <strong>dependency injection</strong> and how we can use that technique to place our test doubles directly in our classes. Now, we&rsquo;ll be able to update the unit tests in our ongoing project to help separate the classes being tested from other classes that it depends on.</p>

# Test Doubles

**Test doubles** are best described by which of the following statements?

1. [X] Temporary objects in unit tests to mimic functionality
1. [ ] Duplicate unit tests used to confirm results
1. [ ] Floating-point values used to test arithmetic methods
1. [ ] Abstract methods with no actual implementation

# Separation of Concerns

The design principle **separation of concerns** is best described by which statement?

1. [X] Breaking a larger system into distinct sections for a particular task
1. [ ] Preventing the user from editing system data in an application
1. [ ] Sandboxing user interface elements from the underlying program
1. [ ] Writing and debugging one part of a program at a time

# Reason for Test Doubles

Which of the following is a major reason to use test doubles in unit tests? 

1. [X] To replace other methods with versions that will always work 
1. [ ] To reduce the amount of code in our unit tests
1. [ ] To repeatedly test other parts of the application
1. [ ] To ensure a test never fails

# Uses of Test Doubles

Which of the following was **not** given as a possible use of test doubles?

1. [X] Measure how long an operation takes to perform
1. [ ] Verify a method is called from our code
1. [ ] Produce fake data that our code can operate on
1. [ ] Enure our code updates data in another module
1. [ ] Observe how many times our code builds a particular object

# Unit Test Pattern

# Stub

According to the text, a **stub** is best described by which statement?

1. [X] An object that returns predefined data when its methods are called
1. [ ] An object that implements all public methods but may use shortcuts to produce results
1. [ ] An object used to listen for incoming method calls
1. [ ] An object that contains several abstract variables

# Fake

According to the text, a **fake** is best described by which statement?

1. [ ] An object that returns predefined data when its methods are called

# Mock

According to the text, a **mock object** is best described by which statement?

1. [ ] An object that returns predefined data when its methods are called
1. [ ] An object that implements all public methods but may use shortcuts to produce results
1. [X] An object used to listen for incoming method calls
1. [ ] An object that contains several abstract variables

# Naming

True or false: the names **stub**, **mock** and **fake** are used consistently across languages and frameworks?

1. [ ] True
1. [X] False

# Dependency Injection

The concept of **dependency injection** is best described by which statement?

1. [X] Building a class so that external objects can be added from outside
1. [ ] Ensuring that all variables and methods are public
1. [ ] Designing a class to construct its own external objects as needed
1. [ ] Only using external libraries from reputable sources
