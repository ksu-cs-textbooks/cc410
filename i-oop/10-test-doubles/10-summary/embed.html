<p>In this chapter, we learned about <strong>test doubles</strong> and how they can use them in our unit tests to mimic functionality from other parts of our program. In short, there are three different common types of test doubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>stubs - methods that mimic actual methods</li>
<li>fakes - objects that mimic actual objects</li>
<li>mocks - objects that record operations performed on it</li>
</ul>
<p>We also explored how we can use these in our code both Java and Python. Finally, we learned about <strong>dependency injection</strong> and how we can use that technique to place our test doubles directly in our classes. Now, we&rsquo;ll be able to update the unit tests in our ongoing project to help separate the classes being tested from other classes that it depends on.</p>
