    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Let’s dive into UML class diagrams a bit. First, we can talk about the basic building block of a Class diagram - the box. Each class in the diagram is represented by a box, and that box has three sections. At the top, we see the name of the class. We may also see a stereotype in the first box if there is something we need to know about the class that is language specific. For example, it could be an enumeration or an interface, and we’d indicate that by adding a stereotype to the first box. The second box contains the attributes of the class. These are typed items, so they will include, at the very least, a name and a type. Most UML diagrams also include the visibility information here, so we would typically see a plus or minus sign at the front of each attribute. Finally, attributes can also include some constraints placed in curly braces at the end of the element. For example, we could place a constraint on an age attribute that it must be greater than 0. Finally, at the bottom, we have the operations, or methods, of the class. For these, we typically include the method’s signature, which encompasses the method name, parameters and their types, and the return type of the method. We may also include the visibility at the front as well.</description>
