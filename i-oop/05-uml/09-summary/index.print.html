<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this section, we learned about UML class diagrams, a language-agnostic approach to visualizing the structure of an object-oriented software system.  We saw how individual classes are represented by boxes divided into three compartments; the first for the identity of the class, the second for its attributes, and the third for its operators. We learned that italics are used to indicate abstract classes and operators, and underlining static classes, attributes, and operators.</p>
<p>We also saw how associations between classes can be represented by arrows with specific characteristics, and examined four of these in detail: aggregation, composition, generalization, and realization.  We also learned how multiplicities can show the number of instances involved in these associations.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw how classes, interfaces, and enumerations are modeled using UML.  We saw how the stereotype can be used to indicate language-specific features like properties.  We also looked at creating UML class diagrams using Diagrams.net and Microsoft Visio.</p>
