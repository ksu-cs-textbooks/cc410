<p>There are two basic types of associations we model with UML: <strong>has-a</strong> and <strong>is-a</strong> associations.  We break these into two further categories, based on the strength of the association, which is either <strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak</strong>.  These associations are:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Association Name</th>
    <th>Association Type</th>
    <th>Typical Usage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Realization</td>
    <td>weak is-a</td>
    <td>Interfaces</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Generalization</td>
    <td>strong is-a</td>
    <td>Inheritance</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aggregation</td>
    <td>weak has-a</td>
    <td>Collections</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Composition</td>
    <td>strong has-a</td>
    <td>Encapsulation</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2 id="is-a-associations">Is-A Associations</h2>
<p>Is-a associations indicate a relationship where one class <strong>is a</strong> instance of another class.  Thus, these associations represent <em>polymorphism</em>, where a class can be treated as another class, i.e. it has both its own, and the associated classes&rsquo; <em>types</em>.</p>
<h3 id="realization-weak-is-a">Realization (Weak is-a)</h3>
<p>Realization refers to making an interface &ldquo;real&rdquo; by implementing the methods it defines. An <strong>interface</strong> is a special type of abstract class that only includes abstract methods. In effect, it is creating an defined list of operations, or an <em>interface</em> (or API), that subclasses must include so that they can all be used in the same way. For Java, this corresponds to a class that implements an <code>interface</code>. The Python language doesn&rsquo;t have interfaces, but we&rsquo;ll learn how to create something similar using abstract classes. We call this a <strong>is-a</strong> relationship, because the class can be treated as being the same data type of the interface class.  It is also a <strong>weak</strong> relationship as the same interface can be implemented by otherwise unrelated classes.  In UML, realization is indicated by a dashed arrow in the direction of implementation:</p>

  CellPhone ..|&gt; Blendable

</div>
-->
<h3 id="generalization">Generalization</h3>
<p>Generalization refers to extracting the shared parts from different classes to make a <em>general</em> base class of what they have in common.  For Java and Python, this corresponds to <em>inheritance</em>.  We call this a <strong>strong is-a</strong> relationship, because the class has all the same state and behavior as the base class.  In UML, realization is indicated by a solid arrow in the direction of inheritance:</p>

  }
  Banana --|&gt; Fruit

</div>
-->
<p>Also notice that we show that <code>Fruit</code> and its <code>blend()</code> method are abstract by italicizing them. The association tells us that the <code>Banana</code> class <strong>is a</strong> <code>Fruit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="has-a-associations">Has-A Associations</h2>
<p>Has-a associations indicates that a class holds one or more references to instances of another class.   In Java or Python, this corresponds to having a variable or collection with the type of the associated class. This is true for both kinds of has-a associations.  The difference between the two is how strong the association is.</p>
<h3 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3>
<p>Aggregation refers to collecting references to other classes.   As the aggregating class has references to the other classes, we call this a <strong>has-a</strong> relationship.  It is considered <strong>weak</strong> because the aggregated classes are only collected by the aggregating class, and can exist on their own.  It is indicated in UML by a solid line from the aggregating class to the one it aggregates, with an open diamond &ldquo;fletching&rdquo; on the opposite site of the arrow (the arrowhead is optional).</p>

-->
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p>Composition refers to assembling a class from other classes, &ldquo;composing&rdquo; it.  As the composed class has references to the other classes, we call this a <strong>has-a</strong> relationship.  However, the composing class typically <em>creates</em> the instances of the classes composing it, and they are likewise destroyed when the composing class is destroyed.  For this reason, we call it a <strong>strong</strong> relationship.  It is indicated in UML by a solid line from the composing class to those it is composed of, with a solid diamond &ldquo;fletching&rdquo; on the opposite side of the arrow (the arrowhead is optional).</p>

<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Aggregation vs. Composition</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Aggregation and composition are commonly confused, especially given they both are defined by holding a variable or collection of another class type. Here&rsquo;s a helpful analogy to explain the difference, based on the diagrams listed above:</p>
<p>Aggregation is like a shopping cart.  When you go shopping, you place groceries into the shopping cart, and it holds them as you push it around the store.  Thus, a <code>ShoppingCart</code> class might have a <code>List&lt;Grocery&gt;</code> named <code>items</code>, and you would add the items to it.  When you reach the checkout, you would then take the items back out.  The individual <code>Grocery</code> objects existed <em>before</em> they were aggregated by the <code>ShoppingCart</code>, and also <em>after</em> they were removed from it. The <code>ShoppingCart</code> class just keeps track of them.</p>
<p>In contract, composition is like an organism.  Say we create a class representing a <code>Dog</code>.  It might be composed of classes like <code>Tongue</code>, <code>Ear</code>, <code>Leg</code>, and <code>Tail</code>.  We would probably construct these parts in the <code>Dog</code> class&rsquo;s constructor, and when we dispose of the <code>Dog</code> object, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect these component classes to stick around. So, they are inherently a part of the encapsulating class.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes the attributes containing these external items may be omitted from the UML diagram of the composing or aggregating class. This is mainly because the existence of those attributes can be inferred by the relationships themselves. However, in this course, we will include the relevant attributes in the encapsulating class, as well as the association arrows, in our UML diagrams</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="multiplicity">Multiplicity</h2>
<p>With aggregation and composition, we may also place numbers on either end of the association, indicating the number of objects involved.  We call these numbers the <em>multiplicity</em> of the association.</p>
<p>
<a href="#image-14d4e532f72b1e6667ccfa1a6a44a274" class="lightbox-link">
<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/5/410_5_composition.svg" alt="Composition in UML" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/images/5/410_5_composition.svg" alt="Composition in UML" class="lightbox-image" loading="lazy">
</a></p>
<p>For example, the <code>Frog</code> class in the composition example has two instances of front and rear legs, so we indicate that each <code>Frog</code> instance (by a <code>1</code> on the Frog side of the association) has exactly two (by the <code>2</code> on the leg side of the association) legs.  The tongue has a <code>1</code> to <code>1</code> multiplicity as each frog has one tongue.</p>
<p>

</a></p>
<p>Multiplicities can also be represented as a range (indicated by the start and end of the range separated by <code>..</code>).  We see this in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> example above, where the count of <code>GroceryItems</code> in the cart ranges from 0 to infinity (infinity is indicated by an asterisk <code>*</code>).</p>
<p>Generalization and realization are always one-to-one multiplicities, so multiplicities are typically omitted for these associations.</p>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at one other important aspect of any UML class diagram - associations. Associations are arrows that we can add between two classes in a UML class diagram that show that those two classes are related in some way. While there is a generic association arrow that we can use, it is much more common for us to see one of four specialized association types in our diagrams. So, let&rsquo;s look at each of those and see what they do.</p>
<p>First, we have the realization relationship, which is sometimes known as the weak is-a relationship. We use this relationship to show that a class is implementing a particular interface class, which is a special type of abstract class that only includes methods. So, in this example, we are saying that the <code>CellPhone</code> class implements the <code>IBlendable</code> interface and includes an implementation of the <code>blend</code> method. Put another way, we could say a cell phone <strong>is a</strong> blend-able item. Notice how that feels like a pretty weak association - a cell phone is not really a subtype of all blend-able items, it just happens to have the ability to be a blend-able item. That&rsquo;s why we call this a weak is-a relationship.</p>
<p>The next one is the generalization relationship, also known as the strong is-a relationship. This association is made between a parent class and a direct subclass, showing that the subclass inherits from the parent class. In this case, we are saying that the <code>Banana</code> class is a child class of the parent <code>Fruit</code> abstract class. Notice that the elements in the <code>Fruit</code> class are italicized, meaning that they are abstract. So, another way we could say this is that a banana <strong>is a</strong> fruit, which feels like a much stronger relationship. Thus, we would call this a strong is-a relationship.</p>
<p>Another type of UML association is aggregation, or a weak has-a relationship. This is for when one class includes a an attribute that stores objects of another class type, but the enclosing class can still stand alone without the objects it would contain. In this diagram, we see an element for a <code>ShoppingCart</code> class, and an association that shows it could contain 0 or more <code>GroceryItem</code> objects. Put another way, we could say that the shopping cart <strong>has a</strong> list of grocery items, but the cart itself is independent of the grocery items, hence why we call this a weak has-a relationship.</p>
<p>The last type of UML association is the composition, or strong has-a relationship. In this association, one class consists of elements of many other classes, but those elements are required in order for the enclosing class to be functional. So, in this diagram, we see that the <code>Frog</code> class contains four legs (two rear and two front), as well as a tongue. In other words, a frog <strong>has</strong> a set of two front legs, two back legs, and a tongue, but without those things it wouldn&rsquo;t really be a frog. So, we&rsquo;d say that this is a strong has-a relationship.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s take a look at an example. Consider this very simple class diagram - what does it tell us? Well, first we see that it consists of two classes, a <code>Professor</code> and a <code>Class</code>. We also see a relationship between the two. Can you tell what type it is? Since it has an open diamond on one end, we know that this is an aggregation, or a weak has-a relationship. Finally, we see some numbers above each end of the association. Those numbers give the multiplicity of the association - how many of each element are present in the association. Here, we can see that there is a 1 on the side of the association next to <code>Professor</code>, while there is a rang of 1 to infinity on the side of the <code>Class</code> element. So, if we read this association out loud, we could say something like &ldquo;One professor has one or more classes,&rdquo; which accurately describes the relationship shown in this diagram.</p>
<p>UML Class Diagrams are a very useful way to reason about the design of our object-oriented programs, and allow us to share information with other developers quickly and easily. Learning to both read UML diagrams as well as create them yourself is a very important skill to practice for any developer, especially if you&rsquo;ll be working on a team with other developers. Hopefully this information has given you a good start, but you&rsquo;ll get plenty of chances to practice your skills throughout the rest of this course. Good luck!</p>
