    <description>Video Materials&#xA;What if we want to have a bit more control over our programs and use a more powerful tool for finding bugs. In that case, weâ€™ll need to use a debugger. A debugger is a special application that allows us to inspect another program while it is running. Using a debugger, we can inspect both the state and behavior of an application, and observe the program directly while it runs. Most debuggers can also be configured to pause a program at a particular line of code, and then execute each following line one at a time to quickly find the source of the error. Both Java and Python come with debuggers that we can use.</description>
