<p>What if we want to have a bit more control over our programs and use a more powerful tool for finding bugs. In that case, we&rsquo;ll need to use a <strong>debugger</strong>. A debugger is a special application that allows us to inspect another program while it is running. Using a debugger, we can inspect both the state and behavior of an application, and observe the program directly while it runs. Most debuggers can also be configured to pause a program at a particular line of code, and then execute each following line one at a time to quickly find the source of the error. Both Java and Python come with debuggers that we can use.</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>In practice, very few developers use a debugger in a standalone way as described below. Instead, typically the debugger is part of their integrated development environment, or IDE. Using a debugger in an IDE is <em>much</em> simpler than using it via the terminal. At the bottom of this page, we&rsquo;ll describe how to use the built-in debugger in Codio, which will be a much simpler experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="java-debugger">Java Debugger</h2>
<p>The Java debugger <code>jdb</code> is a core part of the Java Software Development Kit (SDK), and is already installed for us in Codio. To use the Java debugger, we have to perform two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we execute our Java program, we must provide a special command-line argument to enable debugging. An example would be <code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,server=y,suspend=n</code></li>
<li>Then, once our program is running, we can open the Java debugger in a separate Terminal window using <code>jdb -attach jdbconn</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve started a Java debugger session, we can use several commands to control the application. The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jdb.html" target="_blank">Java Debugger</a>
 manual from Oracle gives a good overview of how to use the application.</p>
<h2 id="python-debugger">Python Debugger</h2>
<p>Python also includes a debugger, called <code>pdb</code>. It can be imported as a library within the code itself, or it can be used as a module when running another script. Similar to the Java debugger, once the debugger is launched, there are many different commands we can use to control the application. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/pdb.html" target="_blank">Python Debugger</a>
 documentation is a great source of information for how to use the Python debugger itself.</p>
<h2 id="codio-debugger">Codio Debugger</h2>
<p>Of course, as you might guess, using a debugger directly on the terminal is a very complex, time-consuming, and painful process. Thankfully, most modern integrated development environments, or IDEs, include a graphical interface for various debuggers, and Codio is no exception. Codio includes a built-in debugger that is capable of debugging both Java and Python code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.codio.com/project/ide/features/#debugging" target="_blank">Codio Documentation</a>
 is a great place to learn about how to use the Codio debugger and all of the features it provides. In the example project for this module, we&rsquo;ll also learn how to quickly integrate a debugger into our larger project in Codio.</p>
<p>Once the Codio debugger is launched, you&rsquo;ll be given a view similar to this one:</p>

<p>On the right, we can see the debugging window that lists the current call stack, any local variables that are visible, as well as watches and breakpoints. A <strong>breakpoint</strong> is a line of code that we&rsquo;ve marked in the debugger that causes execution to stop, or <em>break</em>, when it reaches that line. Basically, we are telling the debugger that we&rsquo;d like to execute the program up to that point. Once the program is paused, we can examine the state and call stack, and decide how we&rsquo;d like to proceed. There are 5 buttons at the top of the debugger panel, and they are described in the Codio documentation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resume</strong> - this tells the debugger to carry on execution without stopping until another breakpoint is encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Stop</strong> - execution will stop and the debug window will be closed.</li>
<li><strong>Step over</strong> - the debugger will execute the next line of code and then stop. If the line of code about to be executed is a function, then it will execute the contents of that function but will not stop within it unless the function contains a breakpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Step into</strong> - the debugger will execute the next line of code and then stop. If the line of code about to be executed is a function, then it will stop on the first line within that function.</li>
<li><strong>Step out</strong> - the debugger will exit the current function and stop on the next line of the calling function. If the current line is the main entry function of the application then execution will cease but and the debugger will restart automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>These five buttons are common to most debuggers, so it is very important to get used to them and how they work. Stepping through your code quickly and efficiently using breakpoints and a debugger is an excellent skill to learn!</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Standard Input for Debugging</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Unfortunately, one major limitation of the Codio debugger is that it does not allow us to accept input via the terminal while the debugger is running. So, we&rsquo;ll have to come up with some other way of providing input to our program if we need to debug it.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to write our program to read input from a file where needed. We can then provide the file name as a command-line argument when the program is launched via the debugger. In our code, if a command-line argument is provided, we know we should read from a file. Otherwise, we should just read from the terminal like usual.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how to do this in our code in many of the previous CC courses, so feel free to go back and review some of that code for examples. We&rsquo;ll also look at how to do this in the example project for this module.</p>

<p>Finally in this chapter, let&rsquo;s briefly discuss both debuggers and loggers and how we can use them to help us find and fix error in our code. First, we can talk about debuggers. Debuggers are special programs that we can use to interactively examine our program while it is running. Both Java and Python have a debugger we can use, as do most programming languages and integrated development environments, or IDEs, including Codio. We&rsquo;ll see how to use the Codio debugger as part of the example project in this module. In short, a debugger allows us to examine both the state and behavior of our program. We can see the values stored in variables while our program executes, and we can pause the program at a particular line of code and run it line-by-line until we find the error. Learning how to use a debugger effectively is a very powerful skill for developers to develop!</p>
<p>This is a quick example of the Codio debugger in action. Here, we have a short python program that is being examined, and the execution of the program is stopped at the line highlighted in red. Next to that line, we see a small red dot, which is a <strong>breakpoint</strong> that was added to our code through the Codio interface. When we run the debugger, the program will run until it reaches a breakpoint. At that point it will pause our program, and we can examine the state. To the right, we see the debugger panel that lists the call stack and variables in our program at that point.</p>
<p>Once our program has been paused by the debugger, we can interactively step through it using the buttons at the top. Most debuggers support these actions: Resume will let our program run until it reaches the next break point. Stop will stop our program completely so we can start it again. Step Over will run the program until it reaches the next line in the current method. If the line we are stopped on is a method call, it will call that method and let it completely finish before pausing on the next line. The other two options are Step Into and Step Out. If our current line is a method call, Step Into allows us to move execution to the code contained in that method, and it will pause at the first line of that method&rsquo;s code. Effectively, we&rsquo;ll add one more layer to the call stack and step into that method&rsquo;s code. Similarly, Step Out will finish executing the current method, and take us down one layer in the call stack, pausing after the line that called the current method. So, using the Step Into and Step Out buttons allow us to somewhat traverse the call stack itself. Pretty handy!</p>
<p>The other helpful tool we can include in our programs is a logger. A logger is a special tool that allows our program to record helpful debugging information in a more useful way, instead of just printing it to the terminal. Loggers can include very complex formatting and handling code, making it easy to explore the logged information later. We can even define different levels of detail, and enable or disable various logging information as needed. So, in this way, we can leave the logging code in our program and just disable it when we are done debugging, instead of having to remember to remove all of our print statements later on. Finally, loggers can integrate with more complex data collection systems, and many large professional software programs include robust logging so companies can keep track of what their users are doing. The textbook includes quick examples for how to include a logger in both Java and Python, as well as links to documentation for both languages. I encourage you to try including a logger in your own code, just to see how it works!</p>
