<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we explored several <strong>software design patterns</strong> introduced by the &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; in their 1994 book: <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>. Design patterns are a great way to build our code using reusable, standard structures that can solve a particular problem or perform a particular task. By using structures that are familiar to other developers, it makes it easier for them to understand our code.</p>
<p>Software design patterns are loosely grouped into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creational Patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>Structural Patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We studied 6 different design patterns. The first three were <strong>creational patterns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Builder Pattern</strong> is useful for building complex objects by offloading the work to a special builder class, letting other classes reference the builder as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Factory Method Pattern</strong> is used to construct objects based on a given parameter, making it easy to get the object you need without needing to even explicitly know the exact type.</li>
<li><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong> allows us to make sure only a single instance of a class is present on a system at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also studied a <strong>structural pattern</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adapter Pattern</strong> is helpful when we need to make an existing class&rsquo;s interface match a different desired interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we looked at two <strong>behavioral patterns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iterator Pattern</strong> allows us to walk through a collection of items, and makes use of the <strong>enhanced for</strong> or <strong>for each</strong> loops present in our language.</li>
<li><strong>Template Method Pattern</strong> allows us to build the internal structure of a method, but then delegate some of the actual computation to methods that can be overridden by subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, we can use these patterns in our code to solve specific problems and hopefully make our program&rsquo;s structure easier for other developers to understand.</p>
