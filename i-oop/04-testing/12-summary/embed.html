<p>In this chapter we learned about testing, both manually using test plans and automatically using a testing framework. We saw how the cost of fixing errors rises exponentially with how long they go undiscovered. We discussed how writing automated tests during the programming phase can help uncover these errors earlier, and how regression testing can help us find new errors introduced while adding to our programs.</p>
<p>We learned a bit more about the testing frameworks we have available to us in our chosen programming language and how to use them. And finally, we discussed some more advanced topics related to software testing.</p>
