As you&amp;rsquo;ve developed programs, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably run them, supplied input, and observed if what happened was what you wanted. This process is known as informal testing. It&amp;rsquo;s informal, because you don&amp;rsquo;t have a set procedure you follow, i.e. what specific inputs to use, and what results to expect. Formal testing adds that structure. In a formal test, you would have a written procedure to follow, which specifies exactly what inputs to supply, and what results should be expected.</description>

      <description>Automated testing is the practice of using a program to test another program. Much as a compiler is a program that translates a program from a higher-order language into a lower-level form, a test program executes a test plan against the program being tested. And much like you must supply the program to be compiled, for automated testing you must supply the tests that need to be executed. In many ways, the process of writing automated tests is like writing a manual test plan - you are writing instructions of what to try, and what the results should be.</description>

Writing tests is in many ways just as challenging and creative an endeavor as writing programs. Tests usually consist of invoking some portion of program code, and then using assertions to determine that the actual results match the expected results. The result of these assertions are typically reported on a per-test basis, which makes it easy to see where your program is not behaving as expected.
Consider a class that is a software control system for a kitchen stove.</description>

      <description>Like most testing frameworks, the JUnit framework provides a host of specialized assertions. They are all created as static methods within the Assertions class, and many of them are described in the JUnit 5 User Guide .
Boolean Assertions For example, JUnit provides two boolean assertions:
assertTrue(condition) - asserts that the value supplied is true assertFalse(condition) - asserts that the value supplied is false As with any assertion statements in JUnit, we can also optionally supply a message string as an additional parameter to these assertion statements.</description>

      <description>We can also choose to use the Hamcrest assertion library in our code, either instead of the JUnit assertions or in addition to them. Hamcrest includes some very helpful assertions that are not part of JUnit, and also includes version for many languages, including both Java and Python. Most of the autograders in previous Computational Core courses are written with the Hamcrest assertion library!
Basic Assertions Hamcrest uses a single basic assertion method called assertThat() to perform all assertions.</description>

      <description>Unlike many testing frameworks, the pytest framework by default only uses the built-in assert statement in Python. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a large number of specialized assertions, and instead relies on the developer to write Boolean logic statements to perform the desired testing. More information can be found in the pytest documentation The pytest framework can leverage the assertions already present in other Python unit testing libraries such as the built-in unittest library.</description>

      <description>Once we&amp;rsquo;ve written our unit tests, we can execute them against our code to see how well it works. Tests are usually run with a test runner, a program that will execute the test code against the code to be tested. The exact mechanism involved depends on the testing framework.
As we discovered in the &amp;ldquo;Hello Real World&amp;rdquo; project, both JUnit and pytest have a way to automatically discover all of the tests we&amp;rsquo;ve created, provided we place them in the correct location and possibly give them the correct name.</description>

      <description>Unit testing is a small part of a much larger world of software testing strategies that we can employ in our workflow. On this page, we&amp;rsquo;ll review some of the more common testing strategies that we may come across.
White Box vs. Black Box Testing First, it is important to differentiate between two different approaches to testing. The white box testing approach means that the developer writing the test has full access to the source code, and it is used to verify not just the functionality of a program as it might appear externally, but also that the internal workings of the program are correct.</description>

      <description>In this chapter we learned about testing, both manually using test plans and automatically using a testing framework. We saw how the cost of fixing errors rises exponentially with how long they go undiscovered. We discussed how writing automated tests during the programming phase can help uncover these errors earlier, and how regression testing can help us find new errors introduced while adding to our programs.
We learned a bit more about the testing frameworks we have available to us in our chosen programming language and how to use them.</description>
