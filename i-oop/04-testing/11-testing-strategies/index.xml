    <title>Testing Strategies :: CC 410 Textbook</title>

    <description>Unit testing is a small part of a much larger world of software testing strategies that we can employ in our workflow. On this page, we’ll review some of the more common testing strategies that we may come across.&#xA;White Box vs. Black Box Testing First, it is important to differentiate between two different approaches to testing. The white box testing approach means that the developer writing the test has full access to the source code, and it is used to verify not just the functionality of a program as it might appear externally, but also that the internal workings of the program are correct.</description>
