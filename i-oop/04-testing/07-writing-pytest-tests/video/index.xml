    <description>Resources Slides Video Script For the Python programming language, we’re going to use the pytest test framework to develop our unit tests. pytest is one of the most popular unit test frameworks for Python today, and it is very easy to use. On this slide, we have a simple pytest test that could be used to test the Square class we introduced in an earlier chapter. For pytest to find the test methods, we have to follow some specific naming standards. In general, our Python file must start with test, the class must have Test in the name, and then the test methods should also begin with test. Typically, we name our test methods with very descriptive names, as that method name is the first thing we’ll see when a test fails. If the method name is descriptive enough, we’ll know exactly what test failed. Then, inside the test, we execute our code, and use one or more assertion statements to verify that the output produced is correct. In this case, we are using the constructor to instantiate a new Square object, and then checking to make sure it sets the length attribute properly. While this may seem obvious, tests like this one are very important - if we aren’t sure that the class sets its attributes correctly, then many of our later tests will also fail.</description>
