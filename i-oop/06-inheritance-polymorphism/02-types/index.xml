      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming languages. This is a topic that comes up many times, and you may have already learned about it in the past. In this course, we&amp;rsquo;re going to dive a bit deeper into how it works and some of the theory behind it. Before we can do that, we should spend a little time talking about data types and how that relates to inheritance.</description>
