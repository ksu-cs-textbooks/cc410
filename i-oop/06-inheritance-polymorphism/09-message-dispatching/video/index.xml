    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Here’s one other important topic to cover when learning about inheritance - message dispatching. As we’ve already learned, message passing is just another way to think about method calls. One class can call a method in another class by passing it a message. However, when we throw inheritance in the mix, it is more difficult to determine where to send that message. There might be multiple different methods that look the same in the superclass as well as the subclass. So, how can we figure out which method to use? Both programming languages handle this situation a bit differently. In Java, it will look at the name of the method as well as the data types of the arguments provided and try to find a compatible match. In this way, Java also allows method overloading, where two methods can share the same name but have different sets of parameters. Python, on the other hand, only looks at the name of the method when determining which method to call. If the parameters are compatible it will work, but if not it will just raise an error when we try to call the method. However, the real interesting thing happens in the case of method overriding. Remember that a method in a superclass can be overridden by the subclass. When that happens, the method call will execute code based on the original object that was instantiated, regardless of the data type it is currently stored in.</description>
