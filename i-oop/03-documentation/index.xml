Developer documentation often faces a challenge not present in other kinds of documents - the need to be able to display snippets of code. Ideally, we want code to be formatted in a way that preserves indentation. We also don&amp;rsquo;t want code snippets to be subject to spelling and grammar checks, especially auto-correct versions of these algorithms, as they will alter the snippets. Ideally, we might also apply syntax highlighting to these snippets.</description>

The Java software development kit (SDK) includes a tool called Javadoc, which can create documentation based on the documentation comments included in the code. Both the Javadoc Documentation and the Google Style Guide include information about how those documentation comments should be structured and the information each should contain. This page will serve as a quick guide for the most common use cases, but you may wish to refer to the documentation linked above for more specific examples and information.</description>

Many Python developers have standardized on the use of docstrings as documentation comments. Both PEP 257 and the Google Style Guide include information about how those documentation comments should be structured and the information each should contain. This page will serve as a quick guide for the most common use cases, but you may wish to refer to the documentation linked above for more specific examples and information.</description>

One of the strategies for combating the challenges of the software crisis is writing clear documentation to support both the end-users who will use the program, as well as other developers who will update and maintain the code.</description>

      <description>Documentation refers to the written materials that accompany program code. Documentation plays multiple, and often critical roles. Broadly speaking, we split documentation into two categories based on the intended audience:
User Documentation is meant for the end-users of the software Developer Documentation is meant for the developers of the software As you might expect, the goals for these two styles of documentation are very different. User documentation instructs the user on how to use the software.</description>

      <title>Code Comments</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/i-oop/03-documentation/04-code-comments/</guid>
      <description>Of course, one of the most important ways that developers can add documentation to their software is through the use of code comments. A code comment is simply extra text added to the source code of a program which is ignored by the compiler or interpreter - it is only visible within the source code itself. Nearly every programming language supports the inclusion of code comments to help describe or explain how the code works, and it is a vital way for developers to make notes, share information, and make sure anyone else reading the code can truly understand what it does.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/i-oop/03-documentation/07-generated-documentation/</guid>
      <description>One of the biggest innovations in documenting software was the development of documentation generation tools. These were programs that would read source code files, and combine information parsed from the code itself and information contained in code comments to generate documentation in an easy-to-distribute form (often HTML).
This approach meant that the language of the documentation was embedded within the source code itself, making it far easier to update the documentation as the source code was refactored.</description>
