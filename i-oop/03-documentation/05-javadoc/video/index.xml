    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Letâ€™s look at what it takes to create a Javadoc comment for our classes and methods. Each Javadoc comment can be broken into three basic parts. First is the summary fragment, which is the first whole sentence in the comment, usually ending with a period. This line gives a short overview of what the class, method, or attribute represents or is used for. Then, after that, we can optionally add additional paragraphs that further explain the element. Each of those paragraphs starts with an opening p tag, but unlike HTML there will be no closing p tag at the end. Instead, a blank line is used to show the end of a paragraph. Finally, both class and method comments may also include one of several tags available as part of the Javadoc standard. These tags are used to add additional information to the comment, such as the author and version of the class, or the method parameters and return value on a method.</description>
