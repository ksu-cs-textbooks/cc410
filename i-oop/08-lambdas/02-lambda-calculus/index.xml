      <description>Resources Slides Video Script In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover another interesting tidbit of programming that you may not have seen before - lambda expressions. Before that, however, we should quickly review where lambdas come from and why they are present in our object-oriented programming languages today. Alonzo Church, shown here, was a famous mathematician who introduced a new system of notation in mathematics, which we call lambda calculus.</description>
