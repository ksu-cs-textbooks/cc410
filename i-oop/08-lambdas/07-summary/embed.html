<p>In this chapter, we introduced <strong>lambda calculus</strong> as the basis for the <strong>functional programming</strong> paradigm. In functional programming, programs are written in a <strong>declarative</strong> language, expressing the desired result as a composition of functions instead of a procedural set of steps to execute.</p>
<p>In Java and Python, this appears as <strong>lambda expressions</strong> or <strong>lambda functions</strong> - small pieces of code that can be used to create <strong>anonymous functions</strong>. In addition, those functions can be treated as <strong>first-class citizens</strong> in our language, so we can store them in variables, pass them as arguments, and more.</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that lambda expressions are not well understood by a large number of programmers who do not have experience with functional programming, we&rsquo;ll generally avoid their use in our code. In most cases, anything that can be done in a lambda expression can also be done using procedural code and functions, and that is much more readable to the average programmer.</p>

# Lambda Calculus

**Lambda calculus** is a formal notation used to describe what?

1. [X] Computation
1. [ ] Mathematics
1. [ ] Algebra
1. [ ] Combinatorics

# Programming Paradigms

The use of lambda calculus leads to what programming paradigm?

1. [X] Functional Programming
1. [ ] Object-Oriented Programming
1. [ ] Procedural Programming
1. [ ] Imperative Programming

# Structured Programming

The **structured programming** paradigm is best described by what statement?

1. [X] Programs are constructed from small parts like ifs and while loops
1. [ ] Programs are lists of commands that modify state
1. [ ] Programs are built from classes representing real-world ideas
1. [ ] Programs are mathematical functions to convert inputs to outputs

# Imperative Programming

The **imperative programming** paradigm is best described by what statement?

1. [ ] Programs are constructed from small parts like ifs and while loops
1. [X] Programs are lists of commands that modify state
1. [ ] Programs are built from classes representing real-world ideas
1. [ ] Programs are mathematical functions to convert inputs to outputs

# Object-Oriented Programming

The **object-oriented programming** paradigm is best described by what statement?

1. [ ] Programs are constructed from small parts like ifs and while loops
1. [ ] Programs are lists of commands that modify state
1. [X] Programs are built from classes representing real-world ideas
1. [ ] Programs are mathematical functions to convert inputs to outputs

# Functional Programming

The **functional programming** paradigm is best described by what statement?

1. [ ] Programs are constructed from small parts like ifs and while loops
1. [ ] Programs are lists of commands that modify state
1. [ ] Programs are built from classes representing real-world ideas
1. [X] Programs are mathematical functions to convert inputs to outputs

# Lambda Expressions

In some languages, **lambda expressions** are also known by what name, mainly because they themselves don't have a name?

1. [X] Anonymous functions
1. [ ] Virtual functions
1. [ ] Function prototypes
1. [ ] Abstract functions

# First-class Citizens

When we say that a function is a **first-class citizen** in a programming language, what does that mean?

1. [X] It can be treated like any other part of the state
1. [ ] It is given a special keyword
1. [ ] It uses special syntax in the compiler or interpreter
1. [ ] It cannot be removed from the program

# State and Behavior

Going back to object-oriented concepts, a **lambda expression** that is treated as a first-class citizen in a language is best described by what statement?

1. [X] Behavior as State
1. [ ] State only
1. [ ] Behavior only
1. [ ] State as Behavior

# Readability

True or false: in general, using lots of lambda expressions in code makes it easier for novice developers to understand the code?

1. [X] False
1. [ ] True
