<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we introduced <strong>lambda calculus</strong> as the basis for the <strong>functional programming</strong> paradigm. In functional programming, programs are written in a <strong>declarative</strong> language, expressing the desired result as a composition of functions instead of a procedural set of steps to execute.</p>
<p>In Java and Python, this appears as <strong>lambda expressions</strong> or <strong>lambda functions</strong> - small pieces of code that can be used to create <strong>anonymous functions</strong>. In addition, those functions can be treated as <strong>first-class citizens</strong> in our language, so we can store them in variables, pass them as arguments, and more.</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that lambda expressions are not well understood by a large number of programmers who do not have experience with functional programming, we&rsquo;ll generally avoid their use in our code. In most cases, anything that can be done in a lambda expression can also be done using procedural code and functions, and that is much more readable to the average programmer.</p>
