      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script The early days of computer science, in the 1950s and 1960s, were times of extreme growth and change in the field. In just a few short years, we went from ENIAC and UNIVAC, the first fully electronic and programmable computers, to commercial machines such as the PDP-1 that could be installed in offices and at universities for everyone to use. During that time, the creation of &amp;ldquo;software&amp;rdquo;, or programs that can run on these computers, became even more important than the creation of new hardware itself.</description>
