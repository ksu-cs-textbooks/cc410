    <title>Language Evolution :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/i-oop/01-hello-real-world/04-evolution/video/</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Video Script To understand how programming languages have evolved over the years, let’s look at a few examples. On this slide is a small snippet of Fortran code from the EPIC model that is linked in the textbook. Take a minute to look through the code and see if you can determine what it does.&#xA;It’s really difficult code to read, isn’t it? We might recognize a few of the keywords like “do” and “if” but for the most part the variables don’t mean anything at all.</description>
