For these videos, I’m doing this all on Windows, which is the most complicated system to set up. For Mac and Linux users, there are similar things that you can do on those systems. If you want me to cover those in a future video, just let me know, and I’d be happy to do that, or you can find really good documentation online.

Take a screenshot of the race condition and store it in a file named race in the project folder. Update ParallelOne to properly use locks to prevent a race condition. Run the program a few times and verify that no race condition occurs. Take a screenshot of the program running correctly and store it in a file named lock in the project folder. See Take a Screenshot on Wikihow for details on how to take a screenshot. On Windows, you can use the “Snipping Tool” to grab only a portion of the screen. See Uploading Files in the Codio documentation for how to upload a screenshot. ParallelTwo Update ParallelTwo following the video to handle blocking and an arbitrary number of threads. Run the program with varying numbers of threads (1 - 10 recommended) and graph the number of threads vs. the time taken. Submit your graph as an image file named graph in the project folder. See How to Make a Single Line Graph in Excel for instructions. Based on the results of the ParallelTwo exercise, write a short blurb in a README.md file in the project folder: How did the number of threads impact amount of time taken to complete the work? What does that result tell us about the hardware available on the Codio system? See below for some example screenshots and graphs. The sample graph shows results for both Java and Python, but your graph will only include one language.",

    "description": "In an object-oriented language, inheritance is a mechanism for deriving part of a class definition from another existing class definition. This allows the programmer to “share” code between classes, reducing the amount of code that must be written.\nConsider the Student class we created earlier:\npublic class Student { private int creditPoints; private int creditHours; private String first; private String last; // accessor methods for first and last omitted public Student(String first, String last) { this.first = first; this.last = last; } /** * Gets the student's grade point average. */ public double getGPA() { return ((double) creditPoints) / creditHours; } /** * Records a final grade for a course taken by this student. * * @param grade the grade earned by the student * @param hours the number of credit hours in the course */ public void addCourseGrade(Grade grade, int hours) { this.creditHours += hours; switch(grade) { case A: this.creditPoints += 4 * hours; break; case B: this.creditPoints += 3 * hours; break; case C: this.creditPoints += 2 * hours; break; case D: this.creditPoints += 1 * hours; break; case F: this.creditPoints += 0 * hours; break; } } } This would work well for representing a student. But what if we are representing multiple kinds of students, like undergraduate and graduate students? We’d need separate classes for each, but both would still have names and calculate their GPA the same way. So, it would be handy if we could say “an undergraduate is a student, and has all the properties and methods a student has” and “a graduate student is a student, and has all the properties and methods a student has.” This is exactly what inheritance does for us, and we often describe it as an is-a relationship. We distinguish this from the interface mechanism we looked at earlier by saying it is a strong is-a relationship, as an Undergraduate student is, for all purposes, also a Student.",

A repository is simply a database of content that you can use, and most languages include a way to automatically find and install libraries that are available in a standard repository.

Likewise, prefixing a Python variable or method name with two underscores will make it appear private to the class, but a developer can simply add the class name to the variable or method name in order to access it.

In short, dependency injection is a way that we can build our classes so that the objects they depend on can be added to the class from outside.

That instance is not accessible outside the class, so we cannot directly interact with it in our unit tests, at least without violating the security principles of the class it is in. So, if we want to test that the submitGrades() method properly grades every student in the studentList, we would need some way to replace the gradebook attribute with a test double.",

Message passing is a way to request a unit of code engage in a behavior, i.e. changing its state, or sharing some aspect of its state.\nConsider the real-world analogue of a letter sent via the postal service. Such a message consists of: an address the message needs to be sent to, a return address, the message itself (the letter), and any data that needs to accompany the letter (the enclosures). A specific letter might be a wedding invitation. The message includes the details of the wedding (the host, the location, the time), an enclosure might be a refrigerator magnet with these details duplicated.

This means that the data type of variables is determined at runtime, and a single variable can store multiple data types throughout the execution of the program.\nWhile this can make development seem quick and easy, it can also cause programmers to make mistakes related to the handling of various data types that wouldn’t be present in statically typed languages such as Java, C++, or C#. Those languages require compilation before they can be executed, and one step that the compiler performs is type checking. Type checking is a process that makes sure each value that is ever assigned to a variable has the correct type - otherwise the program won’t compile properly.",
