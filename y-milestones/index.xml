      <description>This page lists the milestone requirements for the Final Project in CC 410. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.
Purpose This assignment allow students to exercise their programming skills by building a project of their own design.

      <description>This page lists the milestone requirements for the Example 1 - Hello Real World project. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.
Purpose This assignment mimics the traditional &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; project that most programmers learn as their first program, but done following professional coding standards and guidelines. In effect, this is how a professional coder would write &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; as a project for work.</description>
