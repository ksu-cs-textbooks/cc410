      <description>This page lists the milestone requirements for the Example 1 - Hello Real World project. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.
Purpose This assignment mimics the traditional &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; project that most programmers learn as their first program, but done following professional coding standards and guidelines. In effect, this is how a professional coder would write &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; as a project for work.</description>
