      <description>This page lists the milestone requirements for the Example 1 - Hello Real World project. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.&#xA;Purpose This assignment mimics the traditional “Hello World” project that most programmers learn as their first program, but done following professional coding standards and guidelines. In effect, this is how a professional coder would write “Hello World” as a project for work.</description>

      <description>This page lists the milestone requirements for Milestone 1 of the CC 410 Restaurant Project. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.&#xA;Purpose The CC 410 Restaurant Project project for this semester is centered around building a point of sale (POS) system for a fictional restaurant named Game Grub, offering food of all kinds to celebrate our love of games of all kinds.&#xA;This first milestone involves building the classes that represent items on the restaurant’s menu. In a traditional Model-View-Controller software design pattern, these classes would make up the core of the model. This content should be mostly review of concepts learned in prior CC courses with the addition of enumerations (enums). It should not be particularly difficult, but it may be repetitive and time consuming.</description>
