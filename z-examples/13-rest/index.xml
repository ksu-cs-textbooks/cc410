    <title>REST :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/z-examples/13-rest/</link>
    <description>In this example project, we’ll add the ability to update and delete movies in our website using a RESTful architectural style.&#xA;The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.&#xA;For these example projects, you’ll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you’ve accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.</description>

      <description>This page lists the example project requirements for Example 13 in CC 410. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.&#xA;Purpose This example will cover updating an existing project to allow editing and deleting of movies following a RESTful architectural style.&#xA;General Requirements All code must be object-oriented. All executable code must be within a class Python package files such as __init__.py and __main__.py are exempt.</description>

      <description>Errata This video uses the html5 widget module in WTForms, which is no longer present. See below the video for a fix!&#xA;YouTube Video Widget Fix Since this video was recorded, Flask-WTF updated and is now using a newer version of the underlying WTForms library. That library has since deprecated the html5 widgets module and moved them into the main widgets module.&#xA;When running the code as shown in the video, you may receive this error:</description>
