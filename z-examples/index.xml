      <title>Hello Real World</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/01-hello-real-world/</guid>
      <description>YouTube Video
In this example project, we will go through all the steps to create a new version of the classic &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; program, called &amp;ldquo;Hello Real World.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to create unit tests, calculate code coverage, write and generate useful documentation, and use a linter to make sure our code follows a proper coding standard.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if some of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense right now - we&amp;rsquo;ll spend much more time later in this course going into more detail on many of these areas.</description>

      <title>Object-Oriented Programming</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/02-oop/</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/02-oop/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of creating a couple new packages, an enumeration, and a class within a project. This will give you the background you need to complete the first milestone of the restaurant project.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <title>Unit Testing</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/03-unit-testing/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of creating unit tests for an existing project. This is a great example of white-box testing since we&amp;rsquo;ll have access to the source code of the application. As we are developing our tests, we&amp;rsquo;ll also improve the code of the application itself as we find some errors and edge cases that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle very well.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/04-inheritance/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through different forms of inheritance and how they work - including direct inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. This will give us a hands-on way to explore the use of inheritance in our code.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/05-debugging-logging/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through how to use the Codio debugger to explore our program&amp;rsquo;s state and call stack. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore a couple of programs that contain bugs and see if we can fix them. In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to add some simple logging to our code.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/06-design-patterns/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of building several creational design patterns in our code: the builder, factory method, and singleton pattern, as well as the iterator behavioral pattern.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/07-test-doubles/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of adding unit tests to our prior example with design patterns. These unit test will use test doubles to mimic the functionality of various other parts of the program.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>
