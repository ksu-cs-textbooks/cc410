      <title>Hello Real World</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/01-hello-real-world/</guid>
      <description>YouTube Video
In this example project, we will go through all the steps to create a new version of the classic &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; program, called &amp;ldquo;Hello Real World.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to create unit tests, calculate code coverage, write and generate useful documentation, and use a linter to make sure our code follows a proper coding standard.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if some of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense right now - we&amp;rsquo;ll spend much more time later in this course going into more detail on many of these areas.</description>

      <title>Object-Oriented Programming</title>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/02-oop/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of creating a couple new packages, an enumeration, and a class within a project. This will give you the background you need to complete the first milestone of the restaurant project.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <title>Unit Testing</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/03-unit-testing/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of creating unit tests for an existing project. This is a great example of white-box testing since we&amp;rsquo;ll have access to the source code of the application. As we are developing our tests, we&amp;rsquo;ll also improve the code of the application itself as we find some errors and edge cases that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle very well.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include.</description>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/04-inheritance/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through different forms of inheritance and how they work - including direct inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. This will give us a hands-on way to explore the use of inheritance in our code.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/05-debugging-logging/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through how to use the Codio debugger to explore our program&amp;rsquo;s state and call stack. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore a couple of programs that contain bugs and see if we can fix them. In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to add some simple logging to our code.

      <title>GUI Basics</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/06-gui-basics/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/06-gui-basics/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of creating a simple GUI using either Java Swing or Python tkinter. This builds on top of a sample restaurant project, so many of the things we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this example can be directly applied to the upcoming milestone.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <title>Parallel Programming</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/07a-parallel-programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/07a-parallel-programming/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some concepts related to parallel programming. You won&amp;rsquo;t be expected to actually create a fully parallel program in this course, but it is helpful to explore these concepts and see how they impact our program&amp;rsquo;s performance.

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of modifying our previously created GUI and adding in the code to handle events generated by users clicking on various buttons. This will allow us to construct an order of several sundaes within our GUI.
We&amp;rsquo;ll also add some simple unit tests to verify that our GUI is correctly populated by the object it is given, and that it correctly updates the object when saving it.</description>

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the steps of building several creational design patterns in our code: the builder, factory method, and singleton pattern, as well as the iterator behavioral pattern.
In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use mock objects in our unit tests to help us test these new classes.
The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to modify our GUI a bit to handle some of the process of building combos. We&amp;rsquo;ll also look at how we can download and install external libraries into our project, and how we can use them directly within our code.
We&amp;rsquo;ll also add some simple unit tests to verify that our updated GUI is properly loading the panels it should.

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore taking an existing project and preparing it for release. We&amp;rsquo;ll then create the actual release package and upload them to GitHub along with a release tag.

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore taking an existing project and integrating a lightweight web framework into it. In that way, we can use our existing code base within a web application and use it to generate dynamic web pages.

      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore adding a simple search form to our existing movies website. This form will allow us to filter our movies based on a few criteria, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to explore how to receive form data in our web applications.

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc410/z-examples/13-rest/</guid>
      <description>In this example project, we&amp;rsquo;ll add the ability to update and delete movies in our website using a RESTful architectural style.
