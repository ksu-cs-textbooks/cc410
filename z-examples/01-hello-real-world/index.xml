    <description>YouTube Video In this example project, we will go through all the steps to create a new version of the classic “Hello World” program, called “Hello Real World.” We’ll explore how to create unit tests, calculate code coverage, write and generate useful documentation, and use a linter to make sure our code follows a proper coding standard.&#xA;Don’t worry if some of this doesn’t make sense right now - we’ll spend much more time later in this course going into more detail on many of these areas.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video One thing you’ll quickly notice is that the source code files are no longer created for you in this course. Instead, in most cases you’ll be responsible for creating the source code files and folders used by your program.&#xA;So, let’s cover some basics of using the Codio interface and the terminal.&#xA;Codio Interface To the left, you should see the Codio file tree interface. If you don’t see it for some reason, you can always show it by going to the View menu and selecting File Tree.</description>

      <title>GitHub Classroom Setup</title>

      <description>YouTube Video One major new concept in this project is to save the source code of our project on the code sharing website GitHub using a tool called Git. We’ll be using a feature of GitHub called GitHub Classroom to manage several assignments in this course, so let’s explore what it takes to get connected to GitHub Classroom and download this project.&#xA;Accept the Assignment on GitHub Classroom The first step is to accept the assignment on GitHub classroom.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video Once we have accepted the assignment on GitHub classroom and have access to the repository, we can “clone” it in Codio, allowing us to access any starter code and then add our own code as we continue to work through this example project. This project doesn’t include any starter code, but we’ll go ahead and do this step first, just like we would with any other project.</description>

      <description>YouTube Video The last step in this project is to create a GitHub release containing the completed version of your assignment. This is a common part of the software development process - once we are completely ready to go, we can package our code and make it available for others. We’ll cover the process of actually packaging our code for deployment later in this chapter, but for now we’ll learn to create a release on GitHub that we can submit for this project.</description>

      <description>Sample Assignment The assignment description below is meant to mimic the structure that you’ll find in the larger project milestones in this course. It clearly describes the overall desired outcome of the project and how it will be graded.&#xA;For the example projects in this course, this document will be accompanied by a video or instructions showing you how to complete most of the project. For the project milestones, however, you will only be given this document.</description>

      <description>Next Steps This project is a major step toward developing our skills as professional programmers. We introduced a lot of new topics:&#xA;Unit Tests Code Coverage Tests Documentation Comments and Tools Style Checkers Tools to Automate Everything In the next assignment, we’ll start building the first major project in this course. In doing so, you’ll end up redoing a lot of this initial setup, so you’ll be referring back to this project over time.</description>
