    <title>Debugging &amp; Logging :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/z-examples/05-debugging-logging/index.html</link>
    <description>In this example project, we’ll go through how to use the Codio debugger to explore our program’s state and call stack. We’ll explore a couple of programs that contain bugs and see if we can fix them. In addition, we’ll explore how to add some simple logging to our code.&#xA;The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process.</description>

      <description>This page lists the example project requirements for Example 5 in CC 410. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs.&#xA;Purpose This example will cover debugging errors in a couple of existing projects.&#xA;General Requirements This milestone must follow these professional coding standards:&#xA;All code must be object-oriented. All executable code must be within a class Python package files such as __init__.py and __main__.py are exempt. Classes must be organized into packages based on common usage. This project must include automation for compilation, unit testing, documentation generation, and execution. Java: Use Gradle with the application plugin. The project should compile without errors. You may include a main class in a separate package for testing purposes only. Python: Use tox configured to use Python 3.10 and a requirements file to install libraries. You may include a main class in a separate package for testing purposes only. All code must properly compile or be interpreted. Java: It must compile using Gradle. Python: It must be interpreted using Python 3.10. Where specified, type hints should be included in the code, and all code should pass a strict Mypy type check. Submissions to Canvas should be tagged GitHub releases that are numbered according to Semantic Versioning. Unenforced requirements (click to expand): The following requirements ARE NOT enforced for this milestone:</description>

      <description>Resources Codio Debugger Java Logging API Tutorial Configuring Codio Debugger Make sure the application section of build.gradle is set to the correct application.&#xA;Can copy unit test code to a test main function for testing. Codio doesn’t have a good way to individually debug a single unit test, but some IDEs do.</description>

      <description>Update to Python If you run into issues running Python unit tests with Tox after enabling the logging, you may have to add some additional code not covered in the video.

      <description>It appears that I missed an interesting error when developing Example 5 for Python. It is a bit complex, so I’m relying on the advanced formatting of this webpage to help explain it better than I can via email or in a short post to the class. I’ll start with a short version, and then include a longer discussion of the problem and how I came to a solution that I feel is very helpful reading for anyone learning to program and solve these issues in their own work.</description>
