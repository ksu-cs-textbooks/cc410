Hello, and welcome to the week 12 Announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2022. This week we're switching gears from working in the traditional graphical user interfaces. And now we're going to start working on web interfaces. So this week, you're going to have some examples on building data driven websites using either Python or Java, you'll go through the basics of adding a web framework into your existing project. And then you'll basically build a milestone that shows that you can render those pages very quickly. Also, this week, you should start working on the final project. So make sure you get working on that if you haven't already. And if you have started on working on your final project, now's the time to keep working on it. There's only about three weeks left in the semester, so it's a good time to get some of that work done. 

So like I said, for milestone eight, you're going to install a web framework, you're going to set up the routes and the controllers for your web framework. You'll also learn a little bit about layout templates. So you'll set out a template and a route template. And you'll eventually make a data driven menu that shows all of the items at the restaurant all on one web page, it's a really nice way to kind of learn Database Driven websites from the basics. But instead of using a database, we're just going to use our object oriented classes for now. And we'll see how that kind of merges into databases a little bit later. 

Looking ahead for the rest of the semester, you'll spend some time working on form data and filtering, you'll also have a milestone on serialization. As I've been talking about this, these are smaller milestones that are meant to give you more time to work on the final project. And the last restaurant milestone itself is going to be due on finals week. So if you want, you can go ahead and work ahead, all of these milestones are already posted. So you can just work right through them and get them done. Maybe even as soon as before Thanksgiving. So you'll have the rest of the semester to just work on your final project. And then a little bit later, we'll talk about how you finish your final project, you'll either record a video or present to me on Zoom, and I'll be able to see how you did on your final project. 

So now we're at that last part of the semester where we're moving from traditional GUIs to the World Wide Web. I hope this is really interesting and gives you some ideas of how you can actually build web apps using the coding skills that you already know. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and I will look forward to seeing you again next week.
