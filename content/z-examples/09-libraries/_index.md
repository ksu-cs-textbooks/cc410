In this example project, we'll discuss how to modify our GUI a bit to handle some of the process of building combos. We'll also look at how we can download and install external libraries into our project, and how we can use them directly within our code.

We'll also add some simple unit tests to verify that our updated GUI is properly loading the panels it should.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
