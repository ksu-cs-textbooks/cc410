In this example project, we will go through all the steps to create a new version of the classic "Hello World" program, called "Hello Real World." We'll explore how to create unit tests, calculate code coverage, write and generate useful documentation, and use a linter to make sure our code follows a proper coding standard. 

Don't worry if some of this doesn't make sense right now - we'll spend much more time later in this course going into more detail on many of these areas. For now, just follow along so you can see how it all works together. The goal is to give you a bigger picture view first, and then we'll dive into the details later.

You might be wondering: what's the difference between an **example** and a **project** in this course? 

In short, an **example**, such as this one, is one where you are meant to follow along with a pretty detailed set of instructions and guidance to complete a task. Usually we'll use these to introduce something new and give you a small task to explore how it works. 

Then, you'll be able to take what you learned and apply it as part of a **project**. The projects in this course do not include any instructions or guidance. Instead, you are given a set of requirements that you must fulfill, but you have some freedom to meet those requirements however you wish. Most projects will require you to apply what you learned through the example in some new or larger way. 

In addition, several of the projects are designed as **milestones** of a larger overall project, so each project will involve building upon your previous work in a meaningful way.
