In this example project, we'll explore taking an existing project and integrating a lightweight web framework into it. In that way, we can use our existing code base within a web application and use it to generate dynamic web pages.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
