In this example project, we'll explore taking an existing project and preparing it for release. We'll then create the actual release package and upload them to GitHub along with a release tag.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
