In this example project, we'll go through different forms of inheritance and how they work - including direct inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. This will give us a hands-on way to explore the use of inheritance in our code.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first. 

Good luck!
