In this example project, we'll go through the steps of creating a couple new packages, an enumeration, and a class within a project. This will give you the background you need to complete the first milestone of the restaurant project. 

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first. We'll show you how to clone it into Codio so you can use the starter code. 

Good luck!
