In this example project, we'll go through the steps of building several creational design patterns in our code: the builder, factory method, and singleton pattern, as well as the iterator behavioral pattern. 

In addition, we'll explore how to use mock objects in our unit tests to help us test these new classes.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
