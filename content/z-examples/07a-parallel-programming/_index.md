In this example project, we'll explore some concepts related to parallel programming. You won't be expected to actually create a fully parallel program in this course, but it is helpful to explore these concepts and see how they impact our program's performance.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
