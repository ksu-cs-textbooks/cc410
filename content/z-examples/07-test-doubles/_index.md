In this example project, we'll go through the steps of adding unit tests to our prior example with design patterns. These unit test will use test doubles to mimic the functionality of various other parts of the program.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
