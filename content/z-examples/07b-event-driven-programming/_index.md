In this example project, we'll go through the steps of modifying our previously created GUI and adding in the code to handle events generated by users clicking on various buttons. This will allow us to construct an order of several sundaes within our GUI. 

We'll also add some simple unit tests to verify that our GUI is correctly populated by the object it is given, and that it correctly updates the object when saving it.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
