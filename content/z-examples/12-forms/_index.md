In this example project, we'll explore adding a simple search form to our existing movies website. This form will allow us to filter our movies based on a few criteria, and we'll be able to explore how to receive form data in our web applications.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
