In this example project, we'll go through the steps of creating unit tests for an existing project. This is a great example of **white-box testing** since we'll have access to the source code of the application. As we are developing our tests, we'll also improve the code of the application itself as we find some errors and edge cases that it doesn't handle very well.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first. 

Good luck!
