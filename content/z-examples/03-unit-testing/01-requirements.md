This page lists the example project requirements for **Example 3** in CC 410. Read the requirements carefully and discuss any questions with the instructors or TAs. 

## Purpose

This example will cover creating adding unit tests to an existing project. For this example, we'll focus on a simple guessing game.

## General Requirements

{{% notice warning %}}

The first couple of milestones only require a subset of the general requirements introduced in the "Hello Real World" project. Read this section carefully to see what is required for this particular milestone.

{{% /notice %}}

This milestone must follow these professional coding standards:

* **All code must be object-oriented.**
  * All executable code must be within a class
    * Python package files such as `__init__.py` and `__main__.py` are exempt.
  * Classes must be organized into packages based on common usage.
* **This project must include automation for compilation, unit testing, documentation generation, and execution.**
  * Java: Use Gradle with the `application` plugin. The project should compile without errors. You may include a main class in a separate package for testing purposes only.
  * Python: Use tox configured to use Python 3.6 and a requirements file to install libraries. You may include a main class in a separate package for testing purposes only.
* **All code must properly compile or be interpreted.**
  * Java: It must compile using Gradle.
  * Python: It must be interpreted using Python 3.6. Where specified, type hints should be included in the code, and all code should pass a strict Mypy type check.
* **Where specified, code should contain appropriate unit tests that achieve the specified level of code coverage.**
  * Java: Use JUnit 5. You may choose to use Hamcrest for assertions.
  * Python: Use pytest. You may choose to use Hamcrest for assertions.
* **Where specified, code should contain appropriate documentation comments following the language's style guide.**
  * Java: Use javadoc to generate documentation.
  * Python: Use pdoc3 to generate documentation.
* Submissions to Canvas should be tagged GitHub releases that are numbered according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

{{% expand "Unenforced requirements (click to expand):" %}}

The following requirements **ARE NOT** enforced for this milestone, but will be enforced in later milestones that use the same code. We will focus on learning to meet each of these requirements in future modules. However, you are welcome to "plan ahead" by minimizing the number of style errors in your code and adding some basic documentation where desired. 

{{% notice tip tip-0 "Naming Standards" %}}

You can make things easier on yourself by following proper naming standards for your language of choice, even though we aren't enforcing a style guide for this milestone.

* **Java** - All names are in CamelCase. Classes start with uppercase, like `ClassName`, methods and attributes start with lowercase like `methodName`. See the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5-naming).
* **Python** - All names are lowercase with underscores like `method_name`, with the exception of classes, which are named in CamelCase starting with an uppercase letter like `ClassName`. See the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.16-naming).

It is easier to get this correct from the start, then having to refactor your code later. Of course, major refactoring is also a good lesson that guarantees you'll get it right in the future!

{{% /notice %}}

* **(Milestone 3) All code submitted must be free of style errors.** We will be using the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for each language. 
  * Java: Use Checkstyle 8.38+ and the [Google Style Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/checkstyle-8.38/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml). 
    * You may modify the configuration to allow 4 space indentations instead of 2 space indentations.
  * Python: Use Flake8 with the `flake8-docstrings` and `pep8-naming` plugins. Code should conform to PEP 8 style with Google style docstrings.

## Assignment Requirements

This milestone should include the following features:

* Complete Unit Tests for the `GuessingGame` class that achieve 100% code coverage and adequately test all aspects of the code.
* Update `GuessingGame` class to use an enumeration as a return value in the `guess` method.
* Update `GuessingGame` to properly handle punctuation, uppercase and lowercase, and require a minimum length for the secret.
* Complete documentation comments in all code files. Checkstyle or Flake8 should not report any missing documentation.
* Create a `README.md` file in the root of the project, and describe unit tests you feel should be added to the example to cover untested aspects of `GuessingGame`. You **do not** have to write the tests, just discuss aspects you feel are not adequately tested by the tests covered in the video. 
* Create a UML Class Diagram for the entire GuessingGame program (just the source code, you may omit the unit tests). Store the diagram in the root of the project next to `README.md` as an image file (PNG preferred). You may also wish to include any other files used to create the diagram. 
  
## Time Requirements

Completing this project is estimated to require 1 hour.

## Grading Rubric

This assignment will be graded based on the rubric below:

* Updates to `GuessingGame` class - 10%
* Unit Tests - 40%
* Documentation - 30%
* `README.md` file discussing additional tests - 10%
* UML Class Diagram - 10%

The following deductions apply:

* Any portion of the project which will not compile (Java), pass a strict type check (Python), or execute properly will be given a grade of 0.

This is not an exhaustive list of possible deductions. The instructors will strive to provide reasonable and fair grading, but we can't predict all possible defects. It is up to the student to ensure that the project is complete and correct before submission. 

## Submission

Submit this assignment by creating a release on GitHub and uploading the release URL to the assignment on Canvas. You **should not** submit this Codio project or mark it as complete in Codio, in case you need to come back to it and make changes later.
