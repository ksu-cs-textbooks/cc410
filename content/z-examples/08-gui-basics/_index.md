In this example project, we'll go through the steps of creating a simple GUI using either Java Swing or Python tkinter. This builds on top of a sample restaurant project, so many of the things we'll cover in this example can be directly applied to the upcoming milestone.

The next page will discuss the overall requirements that this example project should include. After that, there is a page for each programming language with some basic steps and a video to walk you through the whole process. 

For these example projects, you'll be given some starter code via the GitHub Classroom assignment, so make sure you've accepted the assignment and created your repository in GitHub first.

Good luck!
