In this chapter, we introduced **lambda calculus** as the basis for the **functional programming** paradigm. In functional programming, programs are written in a **declarative** language, expressing the desired result as a composition of functions instead of a procedural set of steps to execute.

In Java and Python, this appears as **lambda expressions** or **lambda functions** - small pieces of code that can be used to create **anonymous functions**. In addition, those functions can be treated as **first-class citizens** in our language, so we can store them in variables, pass them as arguments, and more. 

However, due to the fact that lambda expressions are not well understood by a large number of programmers who do not have experience with functional programming, we'll generally avoid their use in our code. In most cases, anything that can be done in a lambda expression can also be done using procedural code and functions, and that is much more readable to the average programmer.
