The term **polymorphism** means *many forms.*  In computer science, it refers to the ability of a single symbol (i.e. a function or class name) to represent multiple *types*.  Some form of polymorphism can be found in nearly all programming languages. 

While encapsulation of state and behavior into objects is the most central theoretical idea of object-oriented languages, polymorphism - specifically in the form of _inheritance_ - is a close second.  In this chapter we'll look at how polymorphism is commonly implemented in object-oriented languages.
