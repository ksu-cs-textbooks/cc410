In this chapter, we looked at how object-orientation adopted the concept of **encapsulation** to combine related **state and behavior** within a single unit of code, known as a **class**.  We further explored how **objects are instances of a class** created through invoking a **constructor** method.  

We also discussed several different ways of looking at and reasoning about objects - as a **state machine**, and as **structured data stored in memory**.  We discussed how a **method is really a form of message passing** that provides an **interface** to interact with objects safely.

Finally, we explored how all of these concepts are implemented in both the Java and Python programming languages.
