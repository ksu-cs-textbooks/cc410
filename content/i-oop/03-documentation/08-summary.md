In this chapter, we examined the need for software documentation aimed at both end-users and developers (_user documentation_ and _developer documentation_, respectively). We also examined some formats this documentation can be presented in: HTML, Markdown, and XML.  We also discussed _documentation generation_ tools, which generate developer documentation from specially-formatted comments in our code files.  

We examined the both the Java and Python approach to documentation comments, helping other developers understand our code. For this reason, as well as the ability to produce HTML-based documentation using a documentation generator tool, it is best practice to use documentation comments in all our programs.
