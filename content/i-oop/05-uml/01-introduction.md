As software systems became more complex, it became harder to talk and reason about them.  [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) attempted to correct for this by providing a _visual, diagrammatic_ approach to communicate the structure and function of a program.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, a UML diagram might be worth a thousand lines of code.
