Hello, and welcome to the week 10 Announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2023. This week we're going to be working on an external libraries example where we'll talk a little bit more about how we can add code from external sources into our program. Then you work on the eighth milestone in the restaurant project where we'll add some new features. And finally, you'll be asked to do a Start Stop continue survey, which is just your chance to give me some quick feedback as we go through the semester. If there's anything you'd like me to change, about how we're approaching the course. 

So for the eighth milestone, we're going to be updating our GUI to handle orders and combos, so you'll be updating stuff on the sidebar, so that handles orders properly as you add items to your order. And as you edit them, we're also going to add buttons and a new panel for creating and editing combos. So there should be a button for each individual preset combo, plus a custom combo button that you can use to create a custom combo using any entree site and drink that you'd like. The panel for combo should have some basic unit testing, mainly making sure that if you give it a combo, it properly populates it. And also, if you have it properly populated, it saves the correct combo. And then finally, we're going to implement the factory method pattern by abstracting some of our panel code into a panel factory. That will just make it a little bit easier for our button handlers to actually request the correct panel, since we have some duplicated code and a couple of places. Looking ahead for the rest of this class after this milestone, we'll have one more on traditional user interfaces, where we talk about making a release of your project. And also we'll add the checkout functionality to our user interface. 

Then we'll switch over to module 12. And we'll start working on our Web UI. And we'll have a few smaller modules around web UIs. The web milestones are about half the size of these milestones that you're working on right now. So they should go a little bit faster and give you some more time to work on your final project. So that's where we're at. 

Right now. We're working on building a restaurant that serves food and keeps track of orders. So hopefully you can build a tool that Squidward would be able to use to take everybody's order at the Krusty Krab. As always, if you have any questions, let me know otherwise, I will look forward to seeing you again next week.
