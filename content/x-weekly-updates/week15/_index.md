Hello and welcome to the week 15 announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on the last couple of things in this class where we're going to talk about some form validation and some serialization. You'll do a quick example about that and then you'll add that to your restaurant milestone. Other than that, keep working on your final project. This is really the last restaurant milestone and then you'll have a couple of weeks to wrap up your final project. I believe I met with most all of you last week about your final project, so hopefully that's all going well. 

For the rest of the semester, there's a quick quiz on some extras in the textbook that are out there for finals week and then the other big thing is to finish up your final project and present it to me either Monday or Friday of finals week. So remember the deliverables for your final project. You'll need to have a release tag on GitHub that meets most of the requirements, so make sure you read the requirements page. Your code should have proper code documentation just like we've been doing in this class. It should meet all of the basic programming requirements such as having MyPy for typing. It should meet the flake style guide. All of those things still apply to your final project and then you'll do a presentation. 

Your presentation should be around 15 to 20 minutes. You can either pre-record it or you can present it live to me and then you should also schedule some time for some Q&A generally after you submit your video. So if you want, either schedule a time with me Monday or Friday of finals week. There's lots of times open. If you pre-record your presentation, only schedule about 15 minutes for Q&A. It's just a quick chance for me to ask any questions I have after watching your presentation before we turn in your final project. And then finally, a lot of students ask for an outline for your final project presentation. This is listed on the textbook. This is what I recommend. Basically talk about where your project came from, how you implemented it, how well it actually met your needs, talk about any future work you would do if you kept working on it, and then give me a quick demo. 

Finally, last big thing in this class are teaching evaluations. Teaching evaluations will be sent out via email on finals week, so make sure you take some time to fill those out. Remember that teams are anonymous and delayed, I cannot read the T-Vals until after I submit final grades and any and all feedback is welcome both good and bad. This class has changed quite a lot over the past few years that I've taught it and a lot of the feedback has come directly from students via the T-Vals. So I really want you to take some time, tell me what you like, tell me what you don't like, give me suggestions of things I could do better or things that you like that I should keep doing. All of that is very useful in the T-Vals so I appreciate your honest feedback in the T-Vals when those come out on finals week. So other than that we're waving the checkered flag we're at the end of the semester hopefully things are going well. This is the last announcements video I'm going to do for the semester so it's been a great pleasure having all of you in my class this semester and I wish you best of luck in the future.
