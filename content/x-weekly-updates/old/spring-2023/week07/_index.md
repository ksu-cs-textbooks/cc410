Hello, and welcome to the week seven Announcements video for CC 410 in spring 2023. This week you're working on the last of the two new modules that we're working on this one covers test doubles, also known as mocks, you'll be doing an example project around that. And in your work, you're working on the fifth restaurant milestone, which we'll talk about in a minute. You should also be wrapping up the first concept quiz, which is due by the end of this week. So make sure you set aside a couple hours to work on that. Hopefully that goes well. But if you have any questions or concerns, let me know. 

So for the fifth milestone, we're adding unit tests for a lot of the new code we added with design patterns in the previous milestone. And in this milestone, we're going to focus on using test doubles or mock objects in our unit tests. The reason we want to do this is we can focus on only testing one class, for example, we can focus on testing the order class without having to depend on individual items working correctly, so we can create mock items, add them to our order class and very carefully control how our order class actually works. This allows us to build much more powerful unit tests. And it's a really powerful tool to understand when you're building code, especially code that stores other classes inside of it. 

Looking ahead from here, after this module, we'll switch over to work on graphical user interfaces. So we'll spend some time on the basics. We'll talk about event driven programming and parallelism. We'll also talk a little bit about external libraries, building releases, etc. And then finally, we'll spend the last few weeks of the class working on building a web interface as well. 

So we're getting close to halfway we're almost a spring break. Hopefully things are going well in this class. As always, if you have any questions, let me know but good luck on this new milestone. Good luck on the concept quiz. And I will see you again next week.
