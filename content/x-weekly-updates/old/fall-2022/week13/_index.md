Hello, and welcome to the week 13 Announcements video for CC 410 in Fall 2022 This week you should be working on the second of the web milestones. This one you're going to learn about restful API's and also about Web Forms. You'll do an example around using form data to search through the movies collection. And then the milestone will be to create a search form for the items in the menu. As you're working on this project this week, make sure you should be continuing to work on your final project. If you haven't had the third project meeting with me yet, you should have done that you should also be close to doing the fourth project meeting with me, just so I can see your progress on the funnel project. At this point, hopefully you should have some code done. But if you have any questions, or you're still not sure where you're going on the final project, just let me know. 

So like I said, the ninth milestone is all about creating web forms, you're going to create a form for an advanced search through the menu of items on a restaurant. Then you'll create some search filters on the menu to actually filter by keywords by price by calories, things like that. And then you'll have to present the results on a page. Hopefully, you can reuse some of the code from your previous milestone to help present the results in a nice and orderly fashion on the page. So looking ahead, after this milestone, we're going to spend another milestone on restful controllers to actually create custom items. And then we'll have a last little module on serialization and some other concepts that don't fit anywhere else in the class. As I've been talking, don't forget these web milestones are meant to be smaller milestones, they should be a lot easier to complete. That should give you more time to work on the final project. And then don't forget that the last milestone for the restaurant project is due on finals week. 

So we're at week 13. There's really only two more weeks of the semester left after this one and then we'll have finals week, and then we'll be out of here. So hopefully this milestone this week is very useful to help you find exactly what you're looking for even out there in that huge menu that we've gotten in the restaurant project. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to let me know and I look forward to seeing you again in a couple weeks. And I hope you all enjoy your Thanksgiving break.
