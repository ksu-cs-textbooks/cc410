Hello and welcome to the week 10 announcements for CC410 in spring 2025. So this week you should be working on an example of bringing in an external library into our project. We're just gonna do a small example for how to do that. Then you're gonna get started on the eighth restaurant milestone where we're gonna add orders and combos. This is also another instance of the Start, Stop, Continue survey. So it's a good chance for you to give me any feedback that you have on things that are either going well in the class, things you want me to start doing, stop doing, or things you wanna make sure that I continue doing in the class. This is another just good informal anonymous check-in to see how things are going. 

So for milestone eight, we're going to be working on the sidebar at the side of our UI for getting the orders correct. We're gonna add new buttons on the panel for our combos and actually add a new panel for editing the combos themselves. We're also gonna add some basic unit testing to our UI, nothing really particularly fancy, but kind of built on the example of what we've done previously for that. And a lot of this is going to make use of that factory method pattern that we learned a little bit earlier in the class. By the end of this milestone, you should be able to get everything into your sidebar, have your order show up, including combos. And then the next milestone will handle the checkout process where we can actually check out, get a receipt, things like that. So looking ahead after that, next milestone we'll do releases and checkouts. And then after that, we'll switch to the web UI basics. So April 14th is really that deadline where the content of the class starts to trickle off a little bit as we switch over to doing web APIs. So keep an eye out for that, that'll give you more time to work on your final project as you go. 

So we're at a good point where we can finally start to take your order in our user interface. This is one of the best parts of this class where we actually get to bring everything together and see it work as a full point of sale system. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, best of luck with this milestone and I will see you again next week.
