Hello and welcome to the CC 410 week 10 video for spring 2021. You're working on a double week this week so this week is basically continuing the stuff that you've been doing for week nine and week 10. So this week you're going to focus on releases where we actually take our software and package it into a release package that you could then share online you could upload to some of the package managers that we've seen. So you can do lots of cool stuff with that we're not actually going to use it in our project but it's a really cool tool to have in your back pocket. 

But the big thing you're working on this week is milestone seven for the restaurant where you're building the checkout system and actually integrating the orders and combos that you built in milestone six. This is one of the larger milestones, but it's one of the last big milestones for this project. Also this week you should be scheduling a final project meeting with me. Hopefully this time you've got some ideas for your final project you maybe got some code written down and you have an idea of where your path is going forward. We're just about getting into April which means you've got one month and a little bit more than that to work on your final project over the next few weeks. We'll still have a few more restaurant milestones, I'm shooting for probably either 10 or 11 milestones in total so there will be four, three or four more but you'll have more time to work on your final project. These will be slightly smaller milestones than the ones you're used to just to give you a little bit more time to work on your final project. 

So we talked about milestone seven last time, so i'm not going to talk too much more on that. Big thing is getting the GUI for the combo created and then integrating the checkout portions using the external library that i gave. So hopefully this works really well. It's very much an open ended milestone; there's a lot of different ways you could accomplish this so if you have any questions on style or usage or anything like that feel free to ask me via the cc410-help email address or via Discord and I would be happy to help you out with those.  

Looking ahead, I'm working on the next modules right now, probably later today I'm going to record the example for the module 11 which is going to be on web interfaces, and so the next milestone in the restaurant project will be building a simple web interface for the menu but it really starts to open your eyes to what you can do with web technologies in this project. But, like I said we're going to have more few more milestones; there'll be smaller than the previous ones for the restaurant project and the hope is to give you more time to work on your final project toward the first of May.  

So that's all I've got this week. If you have any questions you can always reach me via the cc410-help email address or on Discord. Otherwise, good luck on your milestones, I look forward to meeting you all this week for your final project and keep up the good work!
