Hello, and welcome to the week 12 Announcements video for CC 410 in Spring 2022. So this week, hopefully you should be wrapping up the milestone on checkout and getting all of that working. It's by far the most complex milestone in the course. So hopefully that's going well. But if you still have questions, feel free to contact me today, and I'll do my best to answer your questions throughout today until it's due tonight. Of course, you can always turn it in a little bit late with the late penalty. But please let me know if you're having any major issues with that milestone so I can help you out. 

Starting this week, we're going to pivot over to the next set of milestones, which are all about building an interface via the World Wide Web. And so this week, we've got a few simple milestones on working with data driven websites, the basics of adding a website to your existing project, and then actually building out routes and controllers for that website. So this is the start of the next set of milestones. These milestones are a lot smaller than the previous milestones I'm estimating, they're about a third of the size and the example actually goes through most of the code that you're going to need. So hopefully that will give you more time to work on the final project. Remember, at this point, we're at week 12 out of 16 in the semester, so there's about four weeks left in the semester. So you need to be starting to work on your final project and getting code committed for it so that you've got something to present toward the end of the semester. 

So like I said, in milestone eight, we're going to install a web framework into our existing restaurant project, we're going to use that framework to set up some routes and controllers so that we can actually talk with it via the web, you'll set out some templates for your Master Layouts and for the different routes. And you'll eventually end up with a data driven menu. And so the goal is to have a website that shows the menu of our restaurant. And then we'll build some forms where we can add custom items to the menu, we're not going to do a web ordering platform that's a little bit more complex than we have time to do right now. But we'll definitely be able to present a menu and have a way that people can add custom items to the menu via our web interface. 

So after today, we're going to work with a little form data and filtering over the next few weeks. We're going to learn about serialization. We're learning about restful routes and things like that. But like I said, these are smaller milestones. It's meant to give you more final project time and the last restaurant milestone is due.. I forgot to change that date on my slides... last restaurant milestone would be due I believe May 9. So keep an eye out for that. 

Other than that, I hope you have a good week this week. I hope you can get done with milestone seven and get transferred over to my milestone eight, where you get to work on the World Wide Web. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and I wish you the best of luck.
