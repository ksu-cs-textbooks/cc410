Hello and welcome to the week 13 announcements video for CC 410 in fall 2024. This week you should be working on some more of the restaurant milestones. We've switched gears into the web milestones. So this week you're going to add some restful interfaces and a form interface to your restaurant website. This form interface is going to allow you to add a custom menu item or a list of custom menu items to the menu. They're not going to change the existing menu items. They're just going to add custom information. 

So there's a quick example, then there's a restaurant milestone. These web milestones are meant to be a lot smaller and shorter and easier to complete to give you time to keep working on your final project. So like I said, milestone 11, we're going to add web forms, search filters, and some results that you're going to present from that search interface. It's really great. It's really easy to do. And then from there, we're going to add restful controllers and serialization to handle those custom items. And like I said, more smaller milestones, more final project time for you. And then the big thing to keep in mind is the last restaurant milestone is going to be new finals week. In lieu of a formal final in this class, we're going to do that finals week. You'll also have a final project that is due finals week. And in the future, we'll talk a little bit more about what you'll do to actually turn in that final project by the end of finals week. 

So that's really it. We're looking ahead to the end of the semester. It's week 13 out of 16. So we're getting there pretty quickly. I hope everything's going well for you. And as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise have a great week and I will see you next week.
