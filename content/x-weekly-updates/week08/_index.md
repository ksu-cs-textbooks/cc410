Hello and welcome to the Week 8 announcements video for CC410 in Spring 2025. So this week you should be wrapping up the module on test doubles. I believe most everybody already has that submitted, so that's great. That module builds really nicely on the previous module working with design patterns. And so those two modules kind of go together. I'll work on getting caught up on grading those now that I'm back from my conference. You also should have scheduled and hopefully already had your second final project meeting. If not, make sure you get that scheduled soon. And then you just completed the first concept quiz. And so I'll work on getting that graded this week as well and get caught up on all of that grading. 

So this week we're going to shift gears and we're start going to work on graphical user interfaces or GUIs. So the first one is just a basic GUI example. All you really have to do is follow along with what I do in the milestone and then build out your own GUI yourself. And so this leads to the sixth restaurant milestone. In this one you're going to create the overall GUI structure with a lot of the buttons and some of the fields and things. I'm going to give you one example of how it can look. And if nothing else, if you're not very creative, I encourage you to follow my example because it will work really well. But feel free to get creative if you want to adjust the layout or the colors or the fonts or anything. There's lots and lots of things you can do in this GUI basics module to make your project unique. So feel free to take some time and get creative if you have any time and interest in that. Then looking ahead, we're going to spend some time doing event driven programming where we actually make our user interface interactive. We're going to talk about how we add external libraries to our project, how we build a release version of our project. And then once we shift over into April, we'll shift over to web APIs and spend a little bit of time working on a web interface for a similar project as well. 

So we're finally at the halfway mark of the semester. This is week eight out of 16. So hopefully things are going well. This is kind of the point where we take a little bit of a break with this GUI basics module and having a spring break in here. Then we'll have a couple of larger modules in late March, early April. Peter's off after that. As always, if you have any questions or concerns, let me know. Otherwise, have a safe and happy spring break. And I will see you again in a couple of weeks.
