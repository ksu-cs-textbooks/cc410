Hello, and welcome to the weekend announcements video for CC410 in fall 2025. So, you should be wrapping up the work on test doubles and scheduling your second final project meeting with me. Also, the concept quiz was due. And so I've got most of those graded that are submitted. So, you should be seeing grades on Canvas. If you have any questions on that first concept quiz, let me know. But generally, everybody did really well. So I'm very impressed with that. 

This week, we're going to shift gears and start working on a graphical user interface. So, we're going to do some basics this week of just building out the basic structure of a user interface. And that will be your next restaurant milestone. And so, I'm going to give you an overall GUI structure that I recommend for this project. You don't have to follow that example, but if nothing else, I give one example that I think makes a lot of sense for what we're doing. Make sure you read the hints, but feel free to get creative. If you want to make this project your own, you can change some of the layouts, some of the colors, fonts, structure, whatever you want to do, as long as it meets the requirements that I give in the project. 

So looking ahead after that, we're going to spend some time on event-driven programming, adding some functionality to our user interface, adding in an external library to handle receipts and checkouts and things like that. And then eventually here in a few weeks, we'll get to web APIs and some other information there. 

So we're at the halfway mark of the semester. I'm not going to have too much to say this week. Hopefully, things are going well. If you haven't already, please register for Hack K-State if you're interested and you're in Manhattan. It is this weekend. You can basically hang out in the business building with computer science folks all weekend, get free food, work on your homework, work on projects for Hack K-State, whatever you want to do. It's a great event, so make sure you register for that if you're interested. Otherwise, best of luck, and I will see you again next week. Bye.
