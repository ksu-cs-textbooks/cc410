Hello, and welcome to the Week 8 announcements video for CC410 in fall 2024. This week you should be wrapping up the module on test doubles. You should have also scheduled a meeting with me for your second final project milestone where we'll talk a little bit more about final project ideas. And hopefully you should have also completed the first concept quiz, which goes over some of the big concepts in this class. I'm going to work on getting all of that graded this week. It may take me a couple of days to get through everything, but I'll try and get you feedback as soon as I can. 

So this week we're going to shift gears a little bit and we're going to start working on graphical user interfaces. So this week we'll do a simple graphical interface basics example, and then you have a restaurant milestone where you'll add a basic graphical interface into your restaurant milestone as well. So for this one, I'm going to kind of create the overall GUI structure that we're going to use and give you one example of how to use that with some of the prior stuff that we've worked with. I'll also give you some helpful hints in both the milestone and some of the discussion in the examples. So if nothing else, I really recommend following my overall GUI structure, but feel free to get creative if you want to do something a little bit different or use some different UI elements, you are welcome to do so. This is the one milestone where I really encourage you to be creative and go out there and do stuff for this milestone. I'm really just checking the overall layout of your UI. There won't be much functionality on it at this point. And then in the next mile, we'll actually add some of the functionality with event driven programming. 

So like I said, looking ahead after this module, the next module will introduce event driven programming. Then we'll talk about things like external libraries and creating releases of our project before we shift gears a little bit in November and start talking about web APIs and web interfaces as well. So we're finally at the halfway mark of the semester. It is week eight. Hopefully things are going well. This shift gears to GUI is usually one of the better parts of this class where you get to learn some new stuff. So I hope this is really interesting for you. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to let me know or schedule office hours with me. I'd be happy to help. But otherwise, I will see you again next week.
