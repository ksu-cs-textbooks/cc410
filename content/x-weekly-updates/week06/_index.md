Hello and welcome to the Week 6 Announcement Studio for CC410 in fall 2025. So this week you should be working up the module that introduces debugging and logging. You'll also do some Lambda expressions. There's an example around that. And then you turning in the third restaurant milestone, which is all about inheritance and polymorphism and adding some of that to your project. And hopefully you should be scheduling the second final project meeting with me sometime in the next week or two so we can start talking about some specific ideas you might have about your final project in this class. 

So this week we're going to work on design patterns. I think it's one of the more important parts of the class. So you're going to do an example working around design patterns. You're going to add some classes to your restaurant that represent various design patterns. And then the other thing you're going to work on is the first concept quiz in this course. So for the milestone, you're going to add a class to represent an order. So it's a list of items. You're going to have a combo, which is a set number of items, an entree, a side, and a drink that will have some special features to it. You're going to make a builder that can build those combo classes for you. And then you're going to have a singleton class that keeps track of the next order numbers so that when you create new orders, you'll be able to keep track of that. Don't worry about unit tests for this one. We're going to do unit tests for this one in the next milestone. Originally, I did this as a big two-week milestone, but I found it's easier to have this kind of split out between the two milestones. 

So the second thing you're going to work on this next week is the first concept quiz. This is not an exam, but this is meant to be a quiz of your understanding of some of the deeper concepts that we're covering in this class. There's a two-hour time limit on this concept quiz. It is open book, open notes, open code. However, please don't use tools like ChatGPT to answer these questions. I really want to see your understanding and your thoughts behind some of these concepts. It's going to test things such as your understanding of object-oriented programming theory, your comprehension of code and UML, and a little bit of some of the unit testing that we've covered as well. So do your best on this. It kind of gives you a good checkpoint to see where you're at and how you're doing on the concepts in this course. And so that's coming up later this week. 

The other thing to bear in mind, I will be fully remote the rest of this week. Wednesday through Friday, I'm going to be working outside of the office. And so because of that, email responses are going to be slower. I have my calendar blocked off, but you can email me if you want to schedule an appointment. I just won't have quite as much flexibility to immediately be available for an appointment, but I will get back to you. So if you have questions, drop them in an email. Use the usual communication tools. I will respond. It just might be late in the evening, early in the morning when I have time. So just be aware of that coming up. 

So looking ahead after these modules, we're talking about test doubles. We're going to introduce some things about graphical user interfaces and event-driven programming, and then we're going to go from there. So hopefully things are strumming along okay this semester. Things are seem to be going well. If you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, best of luck, and I will see you all again next week.
