Hello, and welcome to the week 7 announcements video for CC410 in fall 2025. This week, we're going to be introducing the topic of test doubles. This is how we can create fake versions of classes in our unit tests so that when we're testing a class that depends on other classes, such as our order classes or combo classes, we can add in fake other versions of the classes that it depends on so that our unit test tests only the functionality in the class we're testing. It's a really powerful tool. It's something that we should learn very clearly in this class. So it's one of the big outcomes that I want you to get. So you're going to work on that. 

Then you're going to work on your fifth restaurant milestone, which is adding a lot of unit testing using these test doubles to test the new stuff that you added to your restaurant project. And then also don't forget the concept quiz is out there on Canvas. So make sure you're getting that wrapped up before the due date. So like I said, Milestone 5 is all about unit testing for the design patterns that we worked on previously. So things like the combo class and the order class. You're going to use a lot of test doubles for these. I expect your unit tests to use these test doubles, whether you think you need them or not. You really should be using them. And so make sure when you're writing your tests that you're focusing only on testing the one class that you're trying to test. So when you're testing a combo class, assume that everything else is working and you're just testing the combo class itself. But if you do this correctly, it gives you access to a lot more powerful unit tests as you go. 

Looking ahead after this module, once we're done with this, we're going to shift over and start introducing graphical user interfaces. So you get to work on that for a little while. Then we'll talk about some things like libraries, web APIs, and more. So it's week seven. We're close to the middle of the semester. Hopefully things are going well. If you haven't already, make sure you're scheduling your second final project check-in with me to chat about that. Other than that, best of luck. Have a good week. And I will see you again next week.
