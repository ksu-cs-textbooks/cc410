We've covered lots of new topics in this course, but there are always important ideas that get left out or don't fit anywhere else. So, in this final chapter of the book, we'll look at some one-off topics and concepts that we feel are important to cover in this course. For many students, this course serves as a capstone programming course, and we want to make sure you are well prepared as a programmer in the future.

Each page in this chapter covers a different topic, with links to additional resources and reading material where possible. More information will continually be added to this chapter as new topics are considered, so if you have a topic in mind that hasn't been already covered in this course, please contact your course instructor and share your idea. It might just end up in an future version of this book.
