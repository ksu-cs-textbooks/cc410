In this chapter, we covered the background content for working with web applications. We learned about **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, the three core technologies used on the World Wide Web today. We also learned about **HTTP**, the protocol used to request a website from a web server and then receive a response from that server. 

We then explored **static web pages**, which made up the majority of the World Wide Web in the early days. However, as the web became more commonplace, the need for **dynamic web pages** increased. Initially, that process was very rudimentary, but eventually many **web frameworks** were created to simplify that process. 

A web framework follows the same **request-response** model used by HTML. However, it uses the path of the web request, along with any additional data included in the request, to determine what page to render. This is a process called **routing**.

Finally, we saw how many template engines today support **template inheritance**, allowing us to define a hierarchical set of templates that make each page in our web application include the same basic information and structure.

With this information in hand, we can start building a web application as part of our semester project.
