In this chapter, we covered some more information about web APIs. We discovered how they are structured and how we can interact with them in our applications. We even learned a bit about how they handle documentation and authentication.

Of course, this merely scratches the surface of information related to web APIs. A later course in the Computational Core curriculum, CC 515, covers web application development and goes in-depth about how to build and use web APIs using a RESTful architecture.

For this course, we'll simply focus on making a small REST API for a portion of our ongoing project. This allows us to learn a bit about how we could construct our own web APIs and make them available for others.
