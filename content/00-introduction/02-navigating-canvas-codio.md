This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.

When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage. It contains quick links to the course syllabus and Piazza discussion boards. This is handy if you just need to jump to a particular area.

Let's walk through the options in the main menu to the left. The first section is Modules, which is where you'll primarily interact with the course. You'll notice that I've disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.

When you first arrive at the Modules section, you'll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren't working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I'll do so, leaving the introductory module open.

As you look at each module, you'll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says "Complete All Items." Likewise, the following modules may list a number of prerequisite modules, which you must complete before you can access it.

Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you'll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say *view*, which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say *contribute*, *submit*, or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.

Let's click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You've already been to this page by this point. Many course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.

While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.

When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the **Next** button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add **Next** and **Previous** buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I'll click through a couple of items here.

At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You'll notice that I've viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you've already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you've completed.

Continuing down the menu to the left, you'll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.

Next, let's click the Piazza link to look at the Piazza boards for this course. Piazza is an online discussion board specifically tailored for college classes. It supports many cool features such as custom markup for code and math snippets, as well as the ability to directly message all instructors in a course. We'll be using Piazza as the primary communication method in this class. In addition to hosting course discussions, we'll also use Piazza to make general announcements to the class.

Piazza's interface is very simple. On the left, you'll see a list of all current topics in the course. During the course, this is the best place to catch up on what's new. At the top, you can also click on one of several folders or options to add a filter to the list. Piazza also has a section to post course resources, but for this course we'll be using Canvas and Codio for all course materials.

The biggest thing you'll be using Piazza for is chatting with other students and the instructors. To start a new post, just click the **New Post** button at the top of the list. When you do, you'll be asked a few questions about your post. You may choose to post a *Question* if you are asking a question and would like a response, a *Note* that does not require a response but is helpful information for other students or the instructors, or a *Poll* if you have something to be voted on.

For *Questions* and *Notes*, you'll also be asked to choose who the post should be sent to. By default, it will be visible to the entire class. However, you can choose *Instructor(s)* to send that post just to the instructors and TAs of the course. This is a great way for you to send a question to every instructor at once, and one of us can reply quickly.

Next, for all posts, you'll be asked to select a folder to place the post in. Folders will help you and other students quickly find posts relevant to a particular topic, such as a homework assignment or a particular tool used in the course.

Finally, you can enter a title (or summary) and the details for your posts. Please try to make your title as descriptive as possible, as that will help instructors and fellow students find your post easily later on. Once you are ready, click the button at the bottom to submit your post to Piazza.

Before posting in Piazza, you should read the information in the Syllabus regarding netiquette. It gives some important information about our expectation for conduct online in this course. In general, be polite and use clear language, and you should be just fine.

To manage your Piazza account & notification settings, click the gear icon in the upper left. Here you can post a profile picture and update your personal information. In addition, you can manage your email settings. I usually recommend turning on the *Smart Digest* option for new questions and notes, but selecting *Real Time* for any questions or notes you follow. Don't worry, any important course announcements will be sent via email directly from Piazza so you won't miss a thing. You can also download the Piazza app for iPhone and Android to stay connected to the course anytime.

Finally, Piazza also has a very active career and recruiting interface. It is a great way to make yourself available to companies interested in hiring students who have a particular set of skills, such as programming. You can find more information about those features by clicking the links in the upper-right of the window.

Now, let's go back to Canvas and load up one of the Codio projects. To load the first Codio projects, click the **Next** button at the bottom of this page to go to the next part of this module, which is the Codio Introduction tutorial. On that page, there will be a button to click, which opens Codio in a new browser window or tab.

Once Codio loads, it should give you the option to start the *Guide* for that module. You'll definitely want to select that option whenever you load a Codio project for the first time.

From there, you can follow the steps in that guide to learn more about the Codio interface. The first page of the guide continues this video. I'll see you there!
