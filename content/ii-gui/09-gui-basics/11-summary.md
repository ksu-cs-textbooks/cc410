In this chapter, we reviewed the basics of creating **graphical user interfaces**, or GUIs, for our programs. We learned about **GUI frameworks** such as **Java Swing** and **Python tkinter**, and how to use them. 

We saw that applications are contained within **windows**, which are managed by the **window manager**, part of the operating system that our applications are running under. Inside of those windows, we can place controls such as **panels, labels, text inputs**, and more. To arrange those elements, we can use a **layout manager**. 

We then learned how to create a simple "Hello World" GUI in both Java Swing and Python tkinter, which will serve as the basis for the example project attached to this chapter.

In later parts of this course, we'll learn how to react to the various events that are generated by our GUI using **event-driven programming**.
