In this chapter, we learned about the steps we can follow to create packaged released of our applications. We discussed changes we could make to our applications to prepare for a release, as well as the various licenses we can choose to attach to our application.

We also looked at some of the helpful metadata that we may wish to add to our project, and how to deploy our documentation directly to the Internet using GitHub pages. 

Finally, we saw how to create a package in both Java and Python, and how to upload those packages to a release on GitHub. We also discussed the basic steps for uploading a package to the repository for our chosen language. 

In the example project for this module, we'll go through some of the steps for creating our own packaged releases and how to upload them to GitHub.
