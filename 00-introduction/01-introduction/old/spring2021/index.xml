    <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello and welcome to the Computational Core program!&#xA;My name is Russ Feldhausen, and I’ll be one of the instructors for this program. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus&#xA;There are many other instructors and TAs for this program that you may interact with or see in the tutorial videos. They all have been instrumental in the development of this program. Specifically, I’d like to recognize the work of Nathan Bean, the developer of the CIS 400 course on which this course is based. Currently, we have one graduate teaching assistant, Farrukh, who will also be working with us to manage these courses.</description>
