    <title>How to Learn Programming :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/00-introduction/05-how-to-learn-programming/index.html</link>
    <description>Resources Slides The Science of Learning Programming from Nathan Bean’s CIS 400 Textbook The Power of Believing You Can Improve | Carol Dweck - TED Talk on Mindsets and the Power of “Yet” The New Science of Learning: How to Learn in Haromony with your Brain by Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek - Great Book on Learning Constructivism on Wikipedia - Article about Jean Piaget’s Learning Philosophy Toward a Developmental Epistemology of Computer Programming by Raymond Lister - Introduces the Stages of Learning to Program Video Script Before we launch into the course itself, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some information with you regarding what we know about how students learn to program. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence from computer science teachers like me, but theories and research from education researchers who study how humans learn new skills and abilities throughout their lives.If I had to summarize all of this information in as few words as possible, I’d simply say “do the work.” Learning to program is difficult, and the only way to really get good at it is through constant practice and learning. However, that greatly oversimplifies the information that I want to share, and I’m hoping that you’ll find some helpful takeaways from this video that you can incorporate into your learning process.</description>
