    <description>Resources Slides Video Script In this chapter, weâ€™re going to take a deeper look at web APIs and how they work. As you are probably already aware, a web API is an interface to a web application. It defines how we interact with the web server containing the resources of that application, and gives us the ability to access and even sometimes modify those resources. Typically the web API itself defines a set of endpoints, represented as URLs, that we can interact with. It is probably easiest to think of these endpoint URLs as individual functions that we can call on the server. In fact, if we recall that function calling is sometimes referred to as message passing, this analogy makes a lot of sense. In addition, the web API might define a set of parameters expected and the value to be returned, just like a function. Finally, most web APIs are built upon the HTTP protocol. In fact, if we think about it, HTTP itself could be thought of as a web API - it tells us how to interact with a server on the internet, and includes information about the types of requests we can send and the responses to expect.</description>
