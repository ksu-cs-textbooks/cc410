      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Another important concept in the design of web applications is REST. REST is short for &amp;ldquo;Representational State Transfer&amp;rdquo; and is a software architectural style that is used in many web applications. REST can be a bit difficult to understand at first, since there are many different moving parts to put together, but hopefully at the end of this video it makes a bit more sense. The important things to remember about REST is that it creates entirely stateless applications.</description>
