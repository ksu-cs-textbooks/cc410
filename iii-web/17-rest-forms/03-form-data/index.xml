    <description>Content Note Much of the content in this page was adapted from Nathan Bean’s CIS 400 course at K-State, with the author’s permission. That content is licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.&#xA;Form data is simply serialized key/value pairs pulled from a form and encoded using one of the three possible encoding strategies. Let’s look at each in turn.&#xA;x-www-form-urlencoded The default encoding method is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which encodes the form data as a string consisting of key/value pairs. Each pair is joined by a = symbol, and pairs are in turn joined by &amp; symbols. The key and value strings are further encoded using percent encoding (URL encoding), which replaces special characters with a code beginning with a percent sign (i.e. &amp; is encoded to %26). This prevents misinterpretations of the key and value as additional pairs, etc. Percent encoding is also used to encode URL segments (hence the name URL encoding).</description>
