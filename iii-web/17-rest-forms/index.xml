One of the earliest (and still widely used) mechanisms for transferring data from a browser (client) to the server is a form. The &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; is a specific HTML element that contains input fields and buttons the user can interact with.</description>

Many web applications deal with some kind of resource, i.e. people, widgets, records. Much like in object-orientation we have organized the program around objects, many web applications are organized around resources. And as we have specialized ways to construct, access, and destroy objects, web applications need to create, read, update, and destroy resource records (we call these CRUD operations).</description>

Now that we have explored some ideas about getting data from the web server, let&amp;rsquo;s turn our attention to sending data to the web server. One of the earliest approaches for doing so is to use a HTML form sent as a HTTP Request, which we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at in this chapter.</description>

Form data is simply serialized key/value pairs pulled from a form and encoded using one of the three possible encoding strategies. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each in turn.
x-www-form-urlencoded The default encoding method is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which encodes the form data as a string consisting of key/value pairs.</description>

      <description>Once we&amp;rsquo;ve built a website that can send form data using an HTTP POST request to our web application, we need some way to access that information in our controller. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we would accomplish this in Spring.
Spring Path Variables In a previous example, we saw how we can create a route that includes variables directly in the path itself:
@GetMapping(&amp;#34;/greeting/{name}&amp;#34;) public String greetingWithName(@PathVariable String name, Model model) { model.</description>
