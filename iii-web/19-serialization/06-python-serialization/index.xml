    <description>There are many different methods for serializing data in Python. We’ll quickly look at three of them.&#xA;XML Python includes the ElementTree library for processing XML. Unfortunately, due to the way that Python handles objects, we have to write some of the processing ourselves. There are some external libraries that will automatically explore Python objects and build the XML based on its attributes.&#xA;To write an XML file in Python, we can use code similar to this:</description>
