    <title>State Review :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/iii-web/19-serialization/02-state-review/</link>
    <description>First, letâ€™s quickly review the state of a program. Recall from an earlier chapter that the state of a program consists of all of the variables and objects stored in memory. So, any time we create a new variable or instantiate a new object in our code, that adds to the overall state of the program.&#xA;1&#xA;In the diagram above, we can visualize an object in object-oriented programming as the state, with a set of variables in the center, and the behaviors around those variables defining how we can use, interact with, and modify that state.</description>
