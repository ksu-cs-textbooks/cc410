    <title>Template Inheritance :: CC 410 Textbook</title>

    <description>One thing you may have also noticed is that many web applications use the same layout across many different pages. Since each page in a web framework requires a different template, it could be very difficult to make sure that each of those pages includes the same information, and updating them would be a major hassle if there were several hundred or thousands of pages in the application.&#xA;Thankfully, most web frameworks also include the ability for templates to be composed of other templates. In that way, we can create a hierarchical structure of templates, and even create smaller templates that we can reuse over and over again in our code.</description>
