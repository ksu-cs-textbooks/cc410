<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we covered the background content for working with web applications. We learned about <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, the three core technologies used on the World Wide Web today. We also learned about <strong>HTTP</strong>, the protocol used to request a website from a web server and then receive a response from that server.</p>
<p>We then explored <strong>static web pages</strong>, which made up the majority of the World Wide Web in the early days. However, as the web became more commonplace, the need for <strong>dynamic web pages</strong> increased. Initially, that process was very rudimentary, but eventually many <strong>web frameworks</strong> were created to simplify that process.</p>
<p>A web framework follows the same <strong>request-response</strong> model used by HTML. However, it uses the path of the web request, along with any additional data included in the request, to determine what page to render. This is a process called <strong>routing</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw how many template engines today support <strong>template inheritance</strong>, allowing us to define a hierarchical set of templates that make each page in our web application include the same basic information and structure.</p>
<p>With this information in hand, we can start building a web application as part of our semester project.</p>
