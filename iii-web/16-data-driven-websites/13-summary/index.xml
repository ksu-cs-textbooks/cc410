    <description>In this chapter, we covered the background content for working with web applications. We learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the three core technologies used on the World Wide Web today. We also learned about HTTP, the protocol used to request a website from a web server and then receive a response from that server.&#xA;We then explored static web pages, which made up the majority of the World Wide Web in the early days. However, as the web became more commonplace, the need for dynamic web pages increased.
