      <description>Up to this point, we’ve mainly focused on developing an application that can be executed locally on a computer. To use an application like this, users would have to download it and possibly install it on their system. Likewise, as developers, we’ll have to create a release that they can install, and we may have to make sure that the release is compatible with various different operating systems and computer architectures.</description>

These template approaches allow you to write a page using primarily HTML, but embed snippets of another language to execute and concatenate into the final page.</description>

      <title>Request &amp; Response</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/iii-web/16-data-driven-websites/10-request-response/</guid>
      <description>Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how HTTP is a request-response protocol, as shown in this diagram:&#xA;We also discussed how we could write a simple dynamic program to generate a response by concatenating strings together. It was definitely not efficient, but it demonstrated that it is possible to dynamically generate a response to a web request.&#xA;Web frameworks simplify this process greatly by handling most of the work for us.</description>

      <title>Routing</title>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/iii-web/16-data-driven-websites/11-routing/</guid>
      <description>Of course, one major question that we still need to resolve is “how does the web framework look at a web request and determine what code to execute?” To do that, most web frameworks introduce the concept of routing.&#xA;In a web framework, a route is usually a mapping from a path to a particular function in a controller.&#xA;For example, a simple web framework might match the path /, representing the top level page on the server, to a function called getIndex() in one of the controllers in the web application itself.</description>

      <title>Template Inheritance</title>

      <description>One thing you may have also noticed is that many web applications use the same layout across many different pages. Since each page in a web framework requires a different template, it could be very difficult to make sure that each of those pages includes the same information, and updating them would be a major hassle if there were several hundred or thousands of pages in the application.&#xA;Thankfully, most web frameworks also include the ability for templates to be composed of other templates.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we covered the background content for working with web applications. We learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the three core technologies used on the World Wide Web today. We also learned about HTTP, the protocol used to request a website from a web server and then receive a response from that server.&#xA;We then explored static web pages, which made up the majority of the World Wide Web in the early days.</description>
