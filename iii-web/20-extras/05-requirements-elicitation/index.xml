    <title>Requirements Elicitation :: CC 410 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc410/iii-web/20-extras/05-requirements-elicitation/</link>
    <description>On the previous page, we discussed the software development life cycle. One of the most important, and often overlooked, steps in those processes is requirements elicitation. Requirements elicitation is all about determining what the users or customers want from a piece of software that is being developed. While this might sound simple, it can actually be one of the most difficult steps in the whole process. In addition, since it is generally the first step in any new software development task, getting this step right can make everything work smoothly, whereas even a small problem at this step can cause the entire project to fail.</description>
